    </ol>

    <h2>Textbook</h2>
    <p>There is no textbook for this course. Instead, I‑Learn contains
    links to videos and web pages with the preparation material students
    will need.</p>

    <h2>Learning Model</h2>
    <p>We encourage you to learn by study and also by faith
    <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng">D&amp;C 88:118</a>).</p>

    <p>The Five Principles (exercise faith; teach by the Spirit; lay
    hold on the word of God; take action; and love, serve, and teach) of
    the learning model is where you, the student, can take personal
    responsibility and invite the Spirit to be part of your study and
    learning process.</p>

    <p>The three processes (prepare, teach one another, ponder and
    prove) of the BYU-Idaho
    <a href="http://www.byui.edu/learning-model">Learning Model</a> will
    help you deepen your learning experience.
    As a student in ITM&nbsp;101, each week you will prepare before the
    first class of the week by reading articles and watching videos in
    I‑Learn. During class, you will participate in discussions and
    demonstrations to expand your learning and ponder what you have
    learned. Also during class, you and your classmates will teach one
    another as you participate in team activities. Finally, you will
    prove what you have learned with an individual assignment due at the
    end of each week.</p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>Each assignment in this course fits into one of four groups. Each
    group of assignments will contribute to your final grade according
    to the following percentages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>20%—Preparation</div></li>
        <li><div>20%—Class Attendance and Participation</div></li>
        <li><div>50%—Assignments</div></li>
        <li><div>10%—Final Project</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Letter grades will be awarded as follows:</p>
    <table><thead>
        <tr><th colspan="2">Percentage<br>Range</th> <th>Letter<br>Grade</th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td class="number">93%</td> <td class="number">100.00%</td> <td>A</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">90%</td> <td class="number">92.99%</td> <td>A&minus;</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">87%</td> <td class="number">89.99%</td> <td>B+</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">83%</td> <td class="number">86.99%</td> <td>B</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">80%</td> <td class="number">82.99%</td> <td>B&minus;</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">77%</td> <td class="number">79.99%</td> <td>C+</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">73%</td> <td class="number">76.99%</td> <td>C</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">70%</td> <td class="number">72.99%</td> <td>C&minus;</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">67%</td> <td class="number">69.99%</td> <td>D+</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">63%</td> <td class="number">66.99%</td> <td>D</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">60%</td> <td class="number">62.99%</td> <td>D&minus;</td></tr>

    </tbody></table>

    <h2>Late Work</h2>
    <p>For all assignments, there is a 2% penalty for each day that has
    passed since the due date, up to a maximum of 50% penalty for any
    given assignment. This means that you can earn partial credit for
    assignments that you submit after the due date. Your instructor can
    waive late penalties if you, your spouse, or your child are ill. You
    should discuss extenuating circumstances with your instructor prior
    to the assignment due date if possible.</p>

    <h2>BYU-Idaho Policies</h2>
    <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
    <p>“When you are honest in every way, you are able to enjoy peace of
    mind and maintain self-respect. You build the strength of character
    which allows you to be of service to God and others. You are
    trustworthy in the eyes of God and those around you. If you are
    dishonest in your words or actions, you hurt yourself and often hurt
    others as well. If you lie, steal, cheat, or neglect to give the
    full amount of work for your pay, you lose your self-respect. You
    lose the guidance of the Holy Ghost.”<br>
    (“Honesty,” True to the Faith (2004), pg 84)</p>

    <p>Academic Honesty means students do their own work. This also
    means their instructors will evaluate that work. Students should not
    be dishonest—this includes all types of work in their courses. For
    more information, see the university’s
    <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty">Academic Honesty Policy</a>.</p>

    <p>We encourage you to work with your classmates, but you must
    submit your own work for all assignments. Share ideas with your
    classmates; do not share solutions! Assistance from a classmate
    should be on par with the help students would expect from a lab
    assistant.</p>

    <p>We encourage you to use the Internet and generative AI as a
    resource, but you should not copy and paste someone else’s work as
    your own. Cite all sources and follow copyright laws. <strong>When
    in doubt, give credit and be true.</strong> For more information,
    read the
    <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/department/student-resources/generative-ai/generative-ai-policy.html">CSE Department’s generative AI policy</a>.</p>

    <p>The penalty for copying or plagiarism of assignments might be one
    or more of the following: a score of zero (0) on an assignment, a
    failing grade in the class, being asked to withdraw from the class,
    or disciplinary action by the University.</p>

    <h3>Accessibility Services</h3>
    <p>BYU-Idaho does not discriminate against persons with disabilities
    in providing its educational and administrative services and
    programs and follows applicable federal and state law. This policy
    extends to the University’s electronic and information technologies
    (EIT).</p>

    <p>Students with qualifying disabilities should contact the
    Disability Services Office at
    <a href="mailto:accessibility@byui.edu">accessibility@byui.edu</a>
    or <a href="tel:208-496-9210">208-496-9210</a>. Additional
    information about Accessibility Services resources can be found at
    <a href="https://www.byui.edu/accessibility-services">https://www.byui.edu/accessibility-services</a>.</p>

    <h3>Dress and Grooming</h3>
    <p>Students are expected to follow the university’s
    <a href="https://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/#dress-and-grooming-standards">Dress and Grooming Standards</a></p>

    <h3>Preventing Sexual Misconduct</h3>
    <p>BYU-Idaho prohibits sex discrimination by its employees and
    students in all of its education programs or activities. This
    includes all forms of sexual harassment, such as sexual assault,
    dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, conditioning a grade
    or job on participation in sexual conduct, and other forms of
    unwelcome sexual conduct.</p>

    <p>As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a
    safe learning environment for my students and for the campus as a
    whole. University policy requires deans and department chairs, and
    encourages all faculty, to report every incident of sexual
    harassment that comes to their attention. If you encounter or
    experience sexual harassment, please contact the Title IX
    Coordinator at <a href="mailto:titleix@byui.edu">titleix@byui.edu</a>
    or <a href="tel:208-496-9209">208-496-9209</a>. Additional
    information about sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and
    available resources can be found at
    <a href="https://www.byui.edu/titleix">www.byui.edu/titleix</a>.</p>

    <h3>Academic Grievances</h3>
    <p>If you have a concern about your course, we encourage you to
    contact your instructor. If your concern cannot be resolved in this
    way, you may contact the
    <a href="https://www.byui.edu/contact-us">BYU-Idaho Support Center</a>
    to formally register a concern or grievance. You can read more in the
    <a href="https://content.byui.edu/integ/gen/d42e66fd-6e72-448f-a4c2-4d88a4ed26d2/0/Final%20Student%20Grievance%20Policy%20-%20catalog%20version.docx">Student Grievance Policy</a>.</p>
