    <h1>ITM 101 Week 1 - Jobs Assignment</h1>

    <h2>Find jobs you might want someday</h2>
    <p>Use instructor provided ChatGPT/AI prompt to find career paths. Paste this into your favorite AI generator:</p>
    <p>"You are a tutor. Act as an adviser to me and what for my response on each questions. Find a career path for me. Help me find what jobs I might like. Ask me some questions to see what career might be best for me."</p>
    <p>Answer the questions to find some jobs you might enjoy. If you already have a list of jobs you want, you can skip the first step.</p>
    <p>Find and provide links to at least <strong>5 future jobs or internships (5 points)</strong> that you are interested in on indeed.com or linkedin.com. Create that list of at least 5 jobs you want when you graduate or a list of internships that you find online.</p>
    <p><strong>Make a list of projects that you want to work on from the job requirements (5 points)</strong> or preferred requirements that you found in the job listings. For example, if one of the jobs prefers candidates that have used AWS Lambda functions, then make a list of the those skills like "AWS Lambda Functions."</p>
    <p>Find a class at BYU-Idaho that teaches that and if you can't find one, ask around. If you still can't find one, spend a weekend doing it or try to incorporate it into class assignment you already have if possible.</p>
