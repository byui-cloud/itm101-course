    <h1>ITM 101 Week 1 - Jobs Assignment</h1>

    <h2>Find jobs you might want someday</h2>
    <p>Use the following prompt with ChatGPT or another generative AI to
    help you find paths. Paste this prompt into your favorite AI
    generator:</p>

    <p class="gpt">Act as a my adviser to help me find a career path.
    Ask me some questions and wait for my response on each question.
    Then suggest some careers that might be best for me.</p>

    <p>Answer the questions to find some jobs you might enjoy. If you
    already have a list of jobs you want, you can skip the previous
    step.</p>

    <p>Find and provide links to at least <strong>5 future jobs or
    internships (5 points)</strong> that you are interested on
    indeed.com or linkedin.com. Create that list of at least 5 jobs you
    want when you graduate or a list of internships that you find
    online. I would recommend you find 3 internships and 2 full-time
    jobs.</p>

    <p><strong>Make a list of projects that you want to work on from the
    job requirements (5 points)</strong> or preferred requirements that
    you found in the job listings. For example, if one of the jobs
    prefers candidates that have used AWS Lambda functions, then make a
    list of the those skills like “AWS Lambda Functions”.</p>

    <p>Find a class at BYU-Idaho that teaches that and if you can’t find
    one, ask around. If you still can’t find one, spend a weekend doing
    it or try to incorporate it into class assignment you already have
    if possible.</p>

    <p>Submit links to 5 jobs and 5 skills you want to develop.</p>
