    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Day 2</h1>

    <h2>Overview - Brainstorm & Gather Requirements</h2>
    <p> Each week, you will work in a team to build something in the cloud.
        Ideally, a problem, pain, or inconvenience you have in your life that you can solve with a cloud-based solution. 
        It could be a mobile app, a web service, or a desktop application. 
        Today, you will brainstorm ideas and gather requirements for your team project.
        If you have time, you could start building something using AI, but first get the main idea and 6 features.
    </p>

     <h3>Brainstorm something cool to build as a team with the help of AI</h3>
    <p><strong>Deliverable:</strong> Choose one project to build as a team each week. Make sure it solves a problem/pain/issue and is viable to make money.
        Define six features or functionalities of your project. You will work on it every 2nd day of class each week.
         Turn in a screenshot of and describe your personal contribution.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Example questions and prompts for AI:</p>
    <p> "Can you create a fictional case with fun and realistic scenarios for a software creation class that is based on building an app to solve a business need for a _______ company?”</p>
    
    <p><strong>Deliverable:</strong> After you have your business idea and requirements, start using AI to build it. Use
    ChatGPT or AI - Be creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in
    what you did. Turn in a screenshot, code, or description of what you
    learned/did/improved/deployed as a team. Submit your personal
    contribution.</p>

    <p>Example questions and prompts for AI that we will start working on next week:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is JavaScript? What is
        Node.js? Why do you need node.js and a backend?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How do I make a new folder and a new
        JavaScript file on my Mac (or Windows)?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">Please write some Node.js code that
        does&nbsp;...</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How do I ...?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How do I put JavaScript code using Visual
        Studio Code into a JavaScript file and run it?</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Team Presentations</h2>
    <p>For the final week of the course, you need to present your team project that you work on most Wed/Thur for the second day of class each week.
Join a team this week to start planning together. Click on the "People" link below modules and then click on the "Team Final Presentations" tab and join a team. Submit the team number and the names of those on your team you have joined in the "People" page.</p>
    <p>At the end of the semester, you will also rate each of your teammates. Make sure to contribute each week.</p>

    <h2>Today's Submission</h2>
        <ul>
        <p>Everyone needs to turn in the Individual Submission but only one team member needs to turn in the team submission (that person also turns in the individual submission together with the team submission).</p>
        <h3>Individual Submission:</h3>
        <li><div>Join your team/table group on the "People" tab.</div></li>
        <li><div>What ideas did you come up with?</div></li>
        <li><div>Each person still needs to submit an artifact and description of
        their personal contribution to the team from today. </div></li>

        <li><div>What problem/pain/issue does it solve?</div></li>        
        <li><div>Is it viable and how will you make money?</div></li>
