    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Day 2</h1>

    <h2>Overview - Brainstorm & Gather Requirements</h2>
    <p> Each week, you will work in a team to build something in the cloud.
        Ideally, a problem, pain, or inconvenience you have in your life that you can solve with a cloud-based solution. 
        It could be a mobile app, a web service, or a desktop application. 
        Today, you will brainstorm ideas and gather requirements for your team project.
        Start building something using AI.
    </p>

     <h3>Brainstorm something cool to build as a team with the help of AI</h3>
    <p><strong>Deliverable:</strong> Choose one project to build as a team each week. Make sure it solves a problem/pain/issue and is viable to make money.
        Define six features or functionalities of your project. You will work on it every 2nd day of class each week.
         Turn in a screenshot of and describe your personal contribution.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Example questions and prompts for AI:</p>
    <p> "Can you create a fictional case with fun and realistic scenarios for a software creation class that is based on building an app to solve a business need for a _______ company?”</p>
    
    <p><strong>Deliverable:</strong> After you have your business idea and requirements, start using AI to build it. Use
    ChatGPT or AI - Be creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in
    what you did. Turn in a screenshot, code, or description of what you
    learned/did/improved/deployed as a team. Submit your personal
    contribution.</p>

    <p>Example questions and prompts for AI that we will start working on next week:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is JavaScript? What is
        Node.js? Why do you need node.js and a backend?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How do I make a new folder and a new
        JavaScript file on my Mac (or Windows)?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">Please write some Node.js code that
        does&nbsp;...</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How do I ...?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How do I put JavaScript code using Visual
        Studio Code into a JavaScript file and run it?</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Team Presentations</h2>
