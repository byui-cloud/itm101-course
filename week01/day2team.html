    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Day 2 - Part 2</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Help your table finish installing the software. Then, build
    something as a team with the tools we installed and ChatGPT.</p>

    <p>Deliverable: Build something from the tools we installed. Use
    ChatGPT - Be creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in
    what you did. Turn in a screenshot, code, or description of what you
    learned/did/improved/deployed as a team. Describe your personal
    contribution.</p>

    <p>Example questions and prompts for ChatGPT:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is JavaScript? What is
        Node.js?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How do I make a new folder and a new
        JavaScript file on my Mac (or Windows)?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">Please write some Node.js code that
        does&nbsp;...</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How do I ...?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How do I put JavaScript code using Visual
        Studio Code into a JavaScript file and run it?</div></li>
    </ul>
