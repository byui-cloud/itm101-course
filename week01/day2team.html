    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Day 2 - Part 2</h1>

    <h2>Overview - Brainstorm & Gather Requirements</h2>
    <p>Help your table finish installing the software. Each week, you will work in a team to build something in the cloud.
        Ideally, a problem, pain, or inconvenience you have in your life that you can solve with a cloud-based solution. 
        It could be a mobile app, a web service, or a desktop application. 
        Today, you will brainstorm ideas and gather requirements for your team project.
        Start building something as a team with the tools we installed and ChatGPT.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Deliverable:</strong> Build something from the tools we installed. Use
    ChatGPT - Be creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in
    what you did. Turn in a screenshot, code, or description of what you
    learned/did/improved/deployed as a team. Describe your personal
    contribution.</p>

    <p>Example questions and prompts for ChatGPT:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is JavaScript? What is
        Node.js? Why do you need node.js and a backend?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How do I make a new folder and a new
        JavaScript file on my Mac (or Windows)?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">Please write some Node.js code that
        does&nbsp;...</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How do I ...?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How do I put JavaScript code using Visual
        Studio Code into a JavaScript file and run it?</div></li>
    </ul>
