<h1>Week 2: Activity 1</h1>
<h2>Generative AI</h2>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This activity will show you the basic capabilities of Generative AI.
Generative AI uses LLMs (Large Language Models) to take input and
predict what the output should be. ChatGPT popularized this approach by
providing a simple to use chat interface that gives the illusion that
you are talking with the AI through text chat.</p>

<h4>Approximate Time to Complete</h4>
<p>90 minutes</p>

<h4>Hello, World!</h4>
<p>Open ChatGPT in your browser and type the following in the prompt
box:</p>

<p class="chatgpt">What is significant about the phrase Hello, World?</p>

<h4>Getting Instructions</h4>
<p>Try this prompt:</p>

<p class="chatgpt">I would like to make a peanut and butter jelly
sandwich. Please write detailed instructions for me.</p>

<h4>Giving Feedback</h4>
<p>ChatGPT will remember your previous requests, which means you can
make edits to previous prompts in order to change the answers.</p>

<p class="chatgpt">I changed my mind, I would rather have Nutella than
peanut butter.</p>

<h4>Explaining Concepts</h4>
<p>ChatGPT can explain concepts at different levels so that it is easier
to understand.</p>

<p class="chatgpt">Why did the dinosaurs go extinct?</p>

<p class="chatgpt">Explain that to me like I’m a 5 year old.</p>

<h4>Generating Questions</h4>
<p>Sometimes it is hard to know which questions need to be asked when
you don’t know a lot about a topic. ChatGPT can generate a list of
questions for you about topics.</p>

<p class="chatgpt">I want to learn JavaScript, but I don’t know where to
start. What questions do I need to ask?</p>

<h4>Fixing Problems</h4>
<p>ChatGPT is good at fixing a wide range of problems. Try this
prompt:</p>

<p class="chatgpt">Can you fix the grammar in this sentence for me?<br>
<br>
Him and me looked through the telescopes, and we seen all them amazin’
planets in the solar system, like Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, they was
shinin’ so bright!</p>

<h4>Translations</h4>
<p>ChatGPT can do translations from one language to another:</p>

<p class="chatgpt">Translate the following text into Spanish:<br>
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<h4>Internet Searches</h4>
<p>ChatGPT does not search the internet for answers.</p>

<p class="chatgpt">Search the internet for the best prices on
televisions.</p>

<h4>Current Affairs</h4>
<p class="chatgpt">What are the most interesting current world affairs?</p>

<h4>Sensitive Topics</h4>
<p>ChatGPT does not give responses for questions about sensitive topics.
For example, ChatGPT will not tell us how much a person weighs.</p>

<h4>Hallucinations</h4>
<p>ChatGPT is built to act as if it is the authority on all subjects.
However, it is wrong fairly often, even though it thinks it is correct.
This is called a <dfn>hallucination</dfn>.</p>

<h3>Deliverable</h3>
<p>Think of a topic that you are curious about, but don’t know anything
about. Your goal is to become an expert on this topic in 30 minutes. Use
the prompts given to you in the above activity as an example to find out
as much information about the topic as possible.</p>

<p>Make sure you have a conversation with ChatGPT. If there is something
it says that you don’t understand, tell it to explain it in a different
way to help your understanding.</p>

<p>Once you are done, please submit a single page report on the topic.
The report <strong>must</strong> be written by you, because you are the
expert on your chosen topic.</p>
