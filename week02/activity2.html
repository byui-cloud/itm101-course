<h1>Week 2: Activity 2</h1>
<h2>Programming with Generative AI</h2>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Not only is Generative AI good at producing answers to questions, it
can also write code in most programming languages. This activity will
show you several different prompts that you can use to generate code for
specific tasks. At the end of the activity, you will be required to
solve a problem by generating your own prompt. Use Node to complete the
task.</p>

<h4>Approximate Time to Complete</h4>
<p>90 minutes</p>

<h4>Hello, World! in JavaScript</h4>
<p>Open ChatGPT in your browser and enter the following prompt:</p>

<p class="chatgpt">Write a hello world program in JavaScript that runs
in Node.js. Also, show me how I can run this program with Node.js</p>

<h4>Adding Context</h4>
<p>ChatGPT remembers the information that you give it. For example, we
can make sure that it will <strong>always</strong> write JavaScript
programs to be run with Node.js instead of in a web browser. The
following prompt will make ChatGPT remember that you would like to have
all of your JavaScript code examples displayed in a form runnable by
Node.js.</p>

<p class="chatgpt">From now on, write all JavaScript so that it can be
run from a terminal with Node.js</p>

<h4>Add Two Numbers</h4>
<p>Try this prompt:</p>

<p class="chatgpt">Write a JavaScript program that will add two numbers
together and display the output.</p>

<p>and then try this prompt:</p>

<p class="chatgpt">Make sure that I can pass those parameters as
arguments, instead of local variables</p>

<p>Using the examples provided by ChatGPT, you should do the
following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>In VSCode, create a file called <code>numbers.js</code> and
    copy/paste the code into the file</li>
    <li>You will then run the code with a command that looks like this:
    <code>node numbers.js 2 2</code>. The resulting output should be
    <code>4</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Use ChatGPT to Explain Concepts</h4>
<p>Please enter each of the following prompts:</p>
<p class="chatgpt">From now on, answer all questions with example code
in JavaScript</p>
<p class="chatgpt">What is a variable?</p>
<p class="chatgpt">What is a function?</p>
<p class="chatgpt">What are parameters?</p>
<p class="chatgpt">What is an if statement?</p>

<h4>Troubleshooting Code with ChatGPT</h4>
<p>Debugging is the process of finding and fixing problems (bugs) in
your code. ChatGPT can also assist with this process.</p>

<p>Copy and paste this prompt and code into ChatGPT:</p>
<p class="chatgpt">Is there something wrong with this function?<br>
<br>
function multiplyNumbers(a, b) {<br>
  return a / b;<br>
}</p>

<p>Try this prompt too:</p>
<p class="chatgpt">Are there any edge cases that could cause this code
to crash?<br>
<br>
function divideNumbers(a, b) {<br>
  return a / b;<br>
}</p>

<h3>Deliverable</h3>
<p>Using ChatGPT, write a simple program that will do different math
operations on two values. It should support the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>addition</li>
    <li>subtraction</li>
    <li>multiplication</li>
    <li>division</li>
    <li>exponent</li>
</ul>

<p>Create a file called <code>math.js</code> to put your code into. Test
your code by running node in the terminal or command prompt like this
<code>node math.js add 2 2</code> and that should add 2 + 2.</p>

<p>Ask ChatGPT: "Can you give me some simple instructions to run and
test this file?"</p>

<p>Once you have completed the assignment, upload a copy of your
<code>math.js</code> file and a screenshot of your math.js program code
working to Canvas.</p>
