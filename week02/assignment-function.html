    <h1>ITM 101 Week 2 - Create a Math Function</h1>

    <p>Using ChatGPT, write a simple program that will do different math
    operations on two values using Node. It should support the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>addition</div></li>
        <li><div>subtraction</div></li>
        <li><div>multiplication</div></li>
        <li><div>division</div></li>
        <li><div>exponent</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Create a file called <code>mathYOURNAME.js</code> (replace
    YOURNAME with your first and last name) to put your code into.
    EXAMPLE: If your name were Bob Jones, it should be
    <code>mathBobJones.js</code></p>

    <p>Test your code by running node in the terminal or command prompt
    like this <code>node mathYOURNAME.js add 2 2</code> and that should
    add 2 + 2.</p>

    <p>IMPORTANT: Test each function using YOUR OWN student ID one digit
    at a time and take a screenshot of the results: If your student ID
    (BYU‑Idaho I‑number) were 014459303. YOU MUST USE THE NUMBERS FROM YOUR
    ID.</p>

    <p>EXAMPLE OF SCREENSHOT TO TURN IN (but it would be your name and
    your ID numbers, if you run out of numbers start over):</p>

    <p>Ask AI or ChatGPT: <span class="gpt">Can you give me some simple
    instructions to run and test this file?</span></p>

    <p>Once you have completed the assignment, upload a copy of your
    <code>mathYOURNAME.js</code> file and a screenshot of your
    <code>mathYOURNAME.js</code> program code working to Canvas.</p>

    <p>Ask AI or ChatGPT:</p>
    <p>What does math have to do with one outcome of this course: Reflect on the power of gospel centered living and personal integrity in their education, homes, and professional careers with a focus on Jesus Christ.</p>
