    <h1>ITM 101 Week 2 - Create a Math Function</h1>

    <p>Using ChatGPT, write a simple program that will do different math operations on two values. It should support the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>addition</li>
        <li>subtraction</li>
        <li>multiplication</li>
        <li>division</li>
        <li>exponent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Create a file called <code>mathYOURNAME.js</code> (replace YOURNAME with your first and last name) to put your code into. EXAMPLE: If your name were Bob Jones, it should be mathBobJones.js</p>
    <p>Test your code by running node in the terminal or command prompt like this "node math.js add 2 2" and that should add 2 + 2.</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT: Test each function using YOUR OWN student ID one digit at a time and take a screenshot of the results: If your student ID (BYU I number) were 014459303. YOU MUST USE THE NUMBERS FROM YOUR ID.</p>
    <p>EXAMPLE OF SCREENSHOT TO TURN IN (but it would be your name and your ID numbers, if you run out of numbers start over):</p>
    <p><img src="week2functionoutput.png" alt="output of the math function" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/274760/files/119394544" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
    <p>Ask ChatGPT: "Can you give me some simple instructions to run and test this file?"</p>
    <p>Once you have completed the assignment, upload a copy of your mathYOURNAME.js file and a screenshot of your math.js program code working to Canvas.</p>
