    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Day 1</h1>
    <h2>Generative AI</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>This activity will show you the basic capabilities of Generative
    AI. Generative AI uses LLMs (Large Language Models) to take input
    and predict what the output should be. ChatGPT popularized this
    approach by providing a simple to use chat interface that gives the
    illusion that you are talking with the AI through text chat.</p>
    <p>Install the tools for this class. Node.js is how you can run JavaScript code
        on a server/cloud for the backend of a system. Install that on your computer to simulate a backend server.
    </p>

    <h2>AI (30 minutes)</h3>

    <h3>Hello, World!</h3>
    <p>Open up ChatGPT and type the following in the prompt box:</p>
    <p class="gpt">What is significant about the phrase Hello, World?</p>

    <h3>Getting Instructions</h3>
    <p>Try this prompt:</p>
    <p class="gpt">I would like to create a peanut and butter jelly sandwich.
    Please write detailed instructions for me</p>

    <h3>Giving Feedback</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT will remember your previous requests, which means you can
    make edits to previous prompts in order to change the answers.</p>
    <p class="gpt">I changed my mind, I would rather have Nutella than peanut
    butter.</p>

    <h3>Explaining Concepts</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT can explain concepts at different levels so that it is
    easier to understand.</p>
    <p class="gpt">How did World War 2 end?</p>
    <p class="gpt">Explain that to me like I’m a 5 year old?</p>

    <h3>Generating Questions</h3>
    <p>Sometimes it is hard to know which questions need to be asked
    when you don’t know a lot about a topic. ChatGPT can generate a list
    of questions for you about topics.</p>
    <p class="gpt">I want to learn JavaScript, but I don’t know where to
    start. What questions do I need to ask?</p>

    <h3>Fixing Problems</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT is good at fixing a wide range of problems. Try this prompt:</p>
    <p class="gpt">Can you fix the grammar in this sentence for me?<br>
    Him and me looked through the telescopes, and we seen all them
    amazin’ planets in the solar system, like Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn,
    they was shinin’ so bright!</p>

    <h3>Translations</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT can do translations from one language to another:</p>
    <p class="gpt">Translate the following sentence into Spanish:<br>
    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>

    <h2>AI Limitations</h2>
    <h3>Internet Searches</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT does not search the internet for answers.</p>
    <p class="gpt">Search the internet for the best prices on TVs</p>

    <h3>Current News</h3>
    <p class="gpt">What are the most interesting current world
    events/news?</p>

    <h3>Sensitive Topics</h3>
    <p>A prompt for this is not provided, but ChatGPT does not give
    responses for sensitive topics.</p>

    <h3>Hallucinations</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT is built to act as if it is the authority on all
    subjects. However, it is wrong fairly often, even though it thinks
    it is correct. This is called a <dfn>hallucination</dfn>.</p>
