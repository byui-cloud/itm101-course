    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Day 2</h1>

    <h2>Programming with Generative AI</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Complete this assignment with a buddy or your team. Not only is
    Generative AI good at producing answers to questions, it can also
    write code in most programming languages. This activity will show
    you several different prompts that you can use to generate code for
    specific tasks. At the end of the activity, you will be required to
    solve a problem by generating your own prompt.</p>

    <h3>Approximate Time to Complete</h3>
    <p>60 minutes</p>

    <h3>Hello, World! in JavaScript</h3>
    <p>Open ChatGPT in your browsers and enter the following prompt:</p>

    <p class="gpt">Write a hello world program in JavaScript that runs
    in Node.js. Also, show me how I can run this program with
    Node.js</p>

    <h3>Adding context</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT remembers the information that you give it. For example,
    we can make sure that in the current conversation, it will
    <em>always</em> write JavaScript programs to be run with Node.js
    instead of in a web browser. The next prompt will make ChatGPT
    remember that it should write JavaScript code that will run in
    Node.js.</p>

    <p class="gpt">From now on, write all JavaScript so that it can be
    run from a terminal with Node.js</p>

    <h3>Add two numbers</h3>
    <p>Try this prompt</p>
    <p class="gpt">Please write a JavaScript program that will add two
    numbers together and display the result.</p>
    <p>Then this one</p>
    <p class="gpt">Make sure that I can pass the two numbers as
    arguments, instead of local variables.</p>

    <p>Using the examples provided by ChatGPT, you should do the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>In VSCode, create a file called <code>numbers.js</code>
        and copy/paste the code into the file</div></li>
        <li><div>You will then run the code with a command that looks
        like this: <code>node numbers.js 2 2</code>. The resulting
        output should be <code>4</code>.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Use ChatGPT to explain concepts</h3>
    <p>Please run through each of the following prompts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div class="gpt">From now on, answer all questions with
        example code in JavaScript.</div></li>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is a variable?</div></li>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is a function?</div></li>
        <li><div class="gpt">What are parameters?</div></li>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is an if statement?</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Troubleshooting Code with ChatGPT</h3>
    <p>Debugging is the process of finding and fixing mistakes (often
    called bugs) in your code. ChatGPT can also assist with this
    process.</p>
    <p>Copy and paste this prompt and code into ChatGPT:</p>
<pre class="gpt">Is there something wrong with this function?
function multiplyNumbers(a, b) {
  return a / b;
}</pre>

    <p>Try this one too:</p>
<pre class="gpt">Are there any edge cases that could cause this code to crash?
function divideNumbers(a, b) {
  return a / b;
}</pre>

<h3>Gospel Focus</h3>
<p>Ask AI or ChatGPT:</p>
<p>What does math have to do with one outcome of this course: Reflect on the power of Christ-like living and personal integrity in the development and use of technology.</p>
<p>Add a comment to your submission on your thoughts on this topic and AI's response.</p>

    <h2>Using Generative AI to Build Something</h2>
    <p>Now that you have seen how to use Generative AI to write code,
    you will use it to start building your team project.</p>
    <p>Ask AI to build the backend JavaScript that could run the JavaScript using Node.js for some of the features you defined as a team previously.</p>

<h3>Build some of your team project features using AI and Node as a Team</h3>
    <p><strong>Deliverable: Build something new as a team using Node.js
    and ChatGPT/AI to start your team project in this class. Each person could 
    work on one of the features using AI. Work as a team to combine the code or get it in one place. Be
    creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did.
    Turn in a screenshot, code, or description of what you
    did/improved/deployed as a team. Turn in a screenshot of and describe your personal
    contribution.</strong></p>
    <p></p>

     <h2>Troubleshooting Node Installation</h2>
    <p>For this error on Windows "execution of scripts is disabled on this system," open PowerShell as an administrator and run the following: </p>
    <p>Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted</p>

    <h2>Today's Submission</h2>
        <ul>
        <h3>Team Submission:</h3>
        <li><div>Only one person has to turn in the team combined content. </div></li>        
        <li><div>A bullet-point list of the features or functionalities you coded with AI.</div></li>
        <li><div>Create a tasks lists or backlog. Try Trello or something else and turn it in.</div></li>        
        <li><div>Include a list of everyone's first and last names in a
        comment of those who contributed today.</div></li>
        <li><div>Turn in the AI generated code and combined code from the team for today.</div></li>        
        <h3>Individual Submission:</h3>
        <li><div>Each person still needs to submit an artifact/screenshot and description of
        their personal contribution to the team from today. Each person could turn in their code for the feature they worked on individually.</div></li>
        <li><div>Turn in a screenshot of 'node -v' working or your feature code running in the terminal with node.</div></li>
        </ul>
