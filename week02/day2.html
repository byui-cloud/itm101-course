    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Day 2</h1>

    <h2>Programming with Generative AI</h2>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Go through this with a buddy or your team. Not only is Generative AI good at producing answers to questions, it can also write code in most programming languages. This activity will show you several different prompts that you can use to generate code for specific tasks. At the end of the activity, you will be required to solve a problem by generating your own prompt. Use Node to complete the task.</p>
<h5>Approximate Time to Complete</h5>
<p>60 minutes</p>
<h5>Hello, World! in JavaScript</h5>
<p>Open ChatGPT and enter the following prompt:</p>
<p><code>Write a hello world program in JavaScript that runs in Node.js. Also, show me how I can run this program with Node.js</code></p>
<h5>Adding context</h5>
<p>ChatGPT remembers the information that you give it. For example, we can make sure that it will <em>always</em> write JavaScript programs to be run with Node.js instead of in a web browser.</p>
<p><code>From now on, write all JavaScript so that it can be run from a terminal with Node.js</code></p>
<p>This prompt will make ChatGPT remember that you would like to have all of your JavaScript code examples displayed in a form runnable by Node.js.</p>
<h5>Add two numbers</h5>
<p>Try this prompt</p>
<p><code>Write me a JavaScript program that will add two numbers together and display the output</code></p>
<p>Then</p>
<p><code>Make sure that I can pass those parameters as arguments, instead of local variables</code></p>
<p>Using the examples provided by ChatGPT, you should do the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In VSCode, create a file called <code>numbers.js</code> and copy/paste the code into the file</li>
    <li>You will then run the code with a command that looks like this: <code>node numbers.js 2 2</code>. The resulting output should be <code>4</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Use ChatGPT to explain concepts</h5>
<p>Please run through each of the following prompts:</p>
<p><code>From now on, answer all questions with example code in JavaScript</code> <code>What is a variable?</code> <code>What is a function?</code> <code>What are parameters?</code> <code>What is an if statement?</code></p>
<h5>Troubleshooting Code with ChatGPT</h5>
<p>Debugging is the process of finding and fixing problems (bugs) in your code. ChatGPT can also assist with this process.</p>
<p>Copy and paste this prompt and code into ChatGPT:</p>
<div class="snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto">
    <pre class="notranslate"><code>Is there something wrong with this function?

function multiplyNumbers(a, b) {
  return a / b;
}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Try this one too:</p>
<div class="snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto">
    <pre class="notranslate"><code>Are there any edge cases that could cause this code to crash?

function divideNumbers(a, b) {
  return a / b;
}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><strong>Deliverable: Build something new as a team using Node.js and ChatGPT/AI or improve a previous project in this class. Be creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did. Turn in a screenshot, code, or description of what you did/improved/deployed as a team. Describe your personal contribution. </strong></p>
