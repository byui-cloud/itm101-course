    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Day 2</h1>

    <h2>Programming with Generative AI</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Complete this assignment with a buddy or your team. Not only is
    Generative AI good at producing answers to questions, it can also
    write code in most programming languages. This activity will show
    you several different prompts that you can use to generate code for
    specific tasks. At the end of the activity, you will be required to
    solve a problem by generating your own prompt.</p>

    <h3>Approximate Time to Complete</h3>
    <p>60 minutes</p>

    <h3>Hello, World! in JavaScript</h3>
    <p>Open ChatGPT in your browsers and enter the following prompt:</p>

    <p class="gpt">Write a hello world program in JavaScript that runs
    in Node.js. Also, show me how I can run this program with
    Node.js</p>

    <h3>Adding context</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT remembers the information that you give it. For example,
    we can make sure that in the current conversation, it will
    <em>always</em> write JavaScript programs to be run with Node.js
    instead of in a web browser. The next prompt will make ChatGPT
    remember that it should write JavaScript code that will run in
    Node.js.</p>

    <p class="gpt">From now on, write all JavaScript so that it can be
    run from a terminal with Node.js</p>

    <h3>Add two numbers</h3>
    <p>Try this prompt</p>
    <p class="gpt">Please a JavaScript program that will add two numbers
    together and display the result.</p>
    <p>Then this one</p>
    <p class="gpt">Make sure that I can pass the two numbers as
    arguments, instead of local variables.</p>

    <p>Using the examples provided by ChatGPT, you should do the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>In VSCode, create a file called <code>numbers.js</code>
        and copy/paste the code into the file</div></li>
        <li><div>You will then run the code with a command that looks
        like this: <code>node numbers.js 2 2</code>. The resulting
        output should be <code>4</code>.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Use ChatGPT to explain concepts</h3>
    <p>Please run through each of the following prompts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div class="gpt">From now on, answer all questions with
        example code in JavaScript.</div></li>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is a variable?</div></li>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is a function?</div></li>
        <li><div class="gpt">What are parameters?</div></li>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is an if statement?</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Troubleshooting Code with ChatGPT</h3>
    <p>Debugging is the process of finding and fixing mistakes (often
    called bugs) in your code. ChatGPT can also assist with this
    process.</p>
    <p>Copy and paste this prompt and code into ChatGPT:</p>
<pre class="gpt">Is there something wrong with this function?
function multiplyNumbers(a, b) {
  return a / b;
}</pre>

    <p>Try this one too:</p>
<pre class="gpt">Are there any edge cases that could cause this code to crash?
function divideNumbers(a, b) {
  return a / b;
}</pre>

    <p><strong>Deliverable: Build something new as a team using Node.js
    and ChatGPT/AI or improve a previous project in this class. Be
    creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did.
    Turn in a screenshot, code, or description of what you
    did/improved/deployed as a team. Describe your personal
    contribution.</strong></p>

    <p>You could build a ChatGPT learning assistant for this course.</p>
