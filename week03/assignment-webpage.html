    <h1>Week 3 - Create an HTML and Javascript Math Webpage</h1>
    <p>Using ChatGPT, create a simple webpage that adds two numbers
    together or use the math file you made from last week. It should use separate HTML and JavaScript files. Turn in
    the files for your website on Canvas once you have finished.</p>

    <p>Create a file called <code>index.html</code> and paste in the
    HTML from ChatGPT.</p>

    <p>Create a file called <code>YOURNAME.js</code> (replace YOURNAME
    with your first and last name in all lowercase) to put the ChatGPT
    code into. EXAMPLE: If your name were Bob Jones, it should be
    <code>bobjones.js</code></p>

    <p>Test your code by opening Visual Studio Code. Install the Live
    Viewer extension by Ritwick Day (ask ChatGPT if you need help).</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE: Make sure to quit Visual Studio Code, then re-open
    it for these change to function.</strong></p>

    <p>Look at the page by right-clicking on the index.html file and
    select "open with live server."</p>

    <p>Once you have completed the assignment, upload a copy of your
    files (index.html and yourname.js) and a screenshot of your webpage
    working to Canvas.</p>
