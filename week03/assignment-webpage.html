    <h1>ITM 101 Week 3 - Create an HTML and Javascript Math Webpage </h1>

    <p>Using ChatGPT, create a simple webpage that adds two numbers together. It should use separate HTML and JavaScript files. Turn in the files for your website on Canvas once you have finished.</p>
    <p>Create a file called <code>index.html</code> and paste in the HTML from ChatGPT.</p>
    <p>Create a file called <code>yourname.js</code> (replace YOURNAME with your first and last name in all lowercase) to put the ChatGPT code into. EXAMPLE: If your name were Bob Jones, it should be bobjones.js</p>
    <p>Test your code by opening Visual Studio Code. Install the Live Viewer extension by Ritwick Day (ask ChatGPT if you need help).</p>
    <p><img src="install_live_serversteps.png" alt="install_live_serversteps" width="400" height="503"  /></p>
    <p><strong>NOTE: Make sure to quit Visual Studio Code, then re-open it for these change to function.</strong></p>
    <p>Look at the page by right-clicking on the index.html file and select "open with live server."</p>
