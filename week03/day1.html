    <h2>ITM 101 Week 3 Day 1</h2>
    <h1>In-class Activity: What is a Web Site?</h1>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>This activity will demonstrate how websites function at a basic
    level. You will create a simple webpage that is generated with
    ChatGPT.</p>

    <h3>Approximate Time to Complete</h3>
    <p>45 minutes</p>

    <h3>Website Structure</h3>
    <p>When you access a website, the files are stored in a way that the
    computer can understand and know where to find each file.</p>

    <p>Try the following prompt with ChatGPT:</p>
    <p class="gpt">Tell me simply how website’s files are organized?</p>

    <h3>What is an index.html file - talk with your buddy.</h3>
    <p>In the root directory there is a file called index.html that
    exsists for almost every website. Ask ChatGPT about it with the
    prompt below.</p>
    <p class="gpt">What is the importance of the index.html file?</p>

    <p>Let’s create one to see what the code looks like. Use this prompt.</p>
    <p class="gpt">Show me a basic index.html</p>

    <p>Look at the code to see how it is organized. Talk with a buddy
    about it.</p>

    <h3>Other elements of a website</h3>
    <p>The HTML on its own, acts as a backbone to a website. It can give
    us a static page to veiw content but not in the best way. To make
    the page more interactive and pretty, it links to other sources to
    generate the page.</p>

    <p>Ask ChatGPT:</p>
    <p class="gpt">How does the index.html file link to other files?</p>

    <p>To start building our own website, we will just use HTML, but
    eventually we will use ChatGPT to generate more complex sites.</p>

    <h3>Creating HTML</h3>
    <p>Like we’ve seen, we can use ChatGPT to build some basic HTML
    code. Think of a prompt to ask ChatGPT that will generate some HTML
    code.</p>

    <p>Create a new file called <code>mywebsite.html</code> in VS code.
    Take the code that ChatGPT gave you and paste it into this file.</p>

    <h3>Viewing the file</h3>
    <p>Browsers, such as Chrome or Safari, are built to run a couple
    different languages straight from the browser.</p>

    <p class="gpt">What different languages can I run in my browser?</p>

    <p>We can see that HTML can be run from our browser. Take your
    mywebsite.html file and view it in your browser.</p>

    <p>It’s nothing fancy, but it is the base for how websites are created.</p>
