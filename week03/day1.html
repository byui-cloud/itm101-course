    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Week 3 Day 1</h1>
    <h2>What is a Web Site?</h2>
    <h5>Summary</h5>
    <p>This activity will demonstrate how websites function at a basic level. You will create a simple webpage that is generated with ChatGPT.</p>
    <h5>Approximate Time to Complete</h5>
    <p>45 minutes</p>
    <h5><strong>Website Structure</strong></h5>
    <p>When you access a website, the files are stored in a way that the computer can understand and know where to find each file.</p>
    <p>Try the following prompt with ChatGPT:</p>
    <p><code>Tell me simply how website's files are organized?</code></p>
    <h5>What is an index.html file - talk with your buddy.</h5>
    <p>In the root directory there is a file called index.html that exsists for almost every website. Ask ChatGPT about it with the prompt below.</p>
    <p><code>What is the importance of the index.html file?</code></p>
    <p>Let's create one to see what the code looks like. Use this prompt.</p>
    <p><code>show me a basic index.html</code></p>
    <p>Look at the code to see how it is organized. Talk with a buddy about it.</p>
    <h5><strong>Other elements of a website</strong></h5>
    <p>The HTML on its own, acts as a backbone to a website. It can give us a static page to veiw content but not in the best way. To make the page more interactive and pretty, it links to other sources to generate the page.</p>
    <p>Ask ChatGPT:</p>
    <p><code>how does the index.html file link to other files?</code></p>
    <p>To start building our own website, we will just use HTML, but eventually we will use ChatGPT to generate more complex sites.</p>
    <h5><strong>Creating HTML</strong></h5>
    <p>Like we've seen, we can use ChatGPT to build some basic HTML code. Think of a prompt to ask ChatGPT that will generate some HTML code.</p>
    <p>Create a new file called mywebsite.html in VS code. Take the code that ChatGPT gave you and paste it into this file.</p>
    <h5><strong>Viewing the file</strong></h5>
    <p>Browsers, such as Chrome or Safari, are built to run a couple different languages straight from the browser.</p>
    <p><code>What different languages can I run in my browser?</code></p>
    <p>We can see that HTML can be run from our browser. Take your mywebsite.html file and view it in your browser.</p>
    <p>It's nothing fancy, but it is the base for how websites are created.</p>
    <p><strong>Start working on Saturday's assignment.</strong></p>
