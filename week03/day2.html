    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Week 3 Day 2</h1>
    <h2>Building a Web Site</h2>
    <h5>Summary</h5>
    <p>Websites use HTML along with JavaScript and CSS to make them dynamic. This activity will show how to create linked files to include JavaScript on a webpage to make it responsive and interactive.</p>
    <h5>Approximate Time to Complete</h5>
    <p>45 minutes</p>
    <h5>Different ways to include JavaScript into a website</h5>
    <p>Here are the ways we can add JavaScript to our website.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Write JavaScript code in our HTML (This is called embedding)</li>
        <li>Create a separate JavaScript file that links to the HTML file</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are going to use the second one because it increases organization. Give ChatGPT the following guide line.</p>
    <p><code>For all future responses, separate the HTML and JavaScript files</code></p>
    <h5><strong>Organizing files</strong></h5>
    <p>When we link our files together, the computer needs to know where to find the files. For this reason, when you create a website, make a new folder that will hold your index.html file, along with your JavaScript folder.</p>
    <p>Also, now the HTML page will need to know where to find the JavaScript. This will use a &lt;script&gt; tag that chatGPT will set up for you, however you need to be sure to name the JavaScript file just like ChatGPT says.</p>
    <h5><strong>Using JavaScript with HTML</strong></h5>
    <p>You've already seen basic HTML and used it to create a webpage. Now, we're going to add JavaScript to make a page that can do more than display static content. Ask ChatGPT to create an HTML and JavaScript project that will display a persons age if I give it the year they were born.</p>
    <p><strong>Using the file structure talked about above</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a new folder in VS code called ageGenerator</li>
        <li>Create a new file in the folder called index.html and paste ChatGPTs HTML code into it</li>
        <li>Create another new file in the folder named the same as what ChatGPT has it named</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, just as before, you can open the index.html file in your browser and test it out!</p>
    <h5>What can JavaScript do?</h5>
    <p>JavaScript can add a lot of different things to a website, learn briefly about 10 things you can add to a website with JavaScript using ChatGPT.</p>
    <p><strong>Deliverable: Build something new as a team or improve a previous project in this class using Javascript. Use ChatGPT - Be creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did. Turn in a screenshot, code, or description of what you did/improved/deployed as a team. Describe your personal contribution. <br /></strong></p>
