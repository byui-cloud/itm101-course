    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Week 3 Day 2</h1>
    <h2>Building a Web Site</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Websites use HTML along with JavaScript and CSS to make them
    dynamic. This activity will show how to create linked files to
    include JavaScript on a webpage to make it responsive and
    interactive.</p>

    <h3>Approximate Time to Complete</h3>
    <p>45 minutes</p>

    <h3>Different ways to include JavaScript into a website</h3>
    <p>Here are the ways we can add JavaScript to our website.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>Write JavaScript code in our HTML (This is called
        embedding)</div></li>
        <li><div>Create a separate JavaScript file that links to the
        HTML file</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are going to use the second one because it increases
    organization. Give ChatGPT the following guide line.</p>
    <p class="gpt">For all future responses, separate the HTML and
    JavaScript files.</p>

    <h3>Organizing files</h3>
    <p>When we link our files together, the computer needs to know where
    to find the files. For this reason, when you create a website, make
    a new folder that will hold your index.html file, along with your
    JavaScript folder.</p>

    <p>Also, now the HTML page will need to know where to find the
    JavaScript. This will use a &lt;script&gt; tag that chatGPT will set
    up for you. However, you need to be sure to name the JavaScript file
    just like ChatGPT says.</p>

    <h3>Using JavaScript with HTML</h3>
    <p>You’ve already seen basic HTML and used it to create a webpage.
    Now, we’re going to add JavaScript to make a page that can do more
    than display static content. Ask ChatGPT to create an HTML and
    JavaScript project that will display a persons age if I give it the
    year they were born.</p>

    <p><strong>Using the file structure talked about above</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>Create a new folder in VS code for your project or make one called
        <code>ageGenerator</code></div></li>
        <li><div>Create a new file in the folder called
        <code>index.html</code> and paste ChatGPTs HTML code into
        it</div></li>
        <li><div>Create another new file in the folder named the same as
        what ChatGPT has it named</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now, just as before, you can open the <code>index.html</code>
    file in your browser and test it out!</p>

    <h3>What can JavaScript do?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript can add a lot of different things to a website. Use
    ChatGPT to learn about 10 things you can add to a website with
    JavaScript.</p>

    <p><strong>Deliverable: Build something new as a team or improve a
    previous project in this class using Javascript. Use ChatGPT - Be
    creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did.
    Turn in a screenshot, code, or description of what you
    did/improved/deployed as a team. Describe your personal
    contribution.</strong></p>
