    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Week 3 Day 2</h1>
    <h2>Building a Web Site</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Websites use HTML along with JavaScript and CSS to make them
    dynamic. This activity will show how to create linked files to
    include JavaScript on a webpage to make it responsive and
    interactive.</p>

    <h3>Approximate Time to Complete</h3>
    <p>45 minutes</p>

    <h3>Different ways to include JavaScript into a website</h3>
    <p>Here are the ways we can add JavaScript to our website.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>Write JavaScript code in our HTML (This is called
        embedding)</div></li>
        <li><div>Create a separate JavaScript file that links to the
        HTML file</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are going to use the second one because it improves
    organization.</p>

    <h3>Organizing files</h3>
    <p>When we link our files together, the computer needs to know where
    to find the files. For this reason, when you create a website, make
    a new folder that will hold your index.html file, along with your
    JavaScript folder.</p>

    <p>Also, now the HTML page will need to know where to find the
    JavaScript. This will use a &lt;script&gt; tag that chatGPT will set
    up for you. However, you need to be sure to name the JavaScript file
    just like ChatGPT says.</p>

    <h3>Using JavaScript with HTML</h3>
    <p>You’ve already seen basic HTML and used it to create a webpage.
    That webpage was probably static, meaning the content of the page
    doesn’t change in a web browser. For this activity, you will create
    a web page that uses JavaScript to make the page dynamic.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Create a new folder for this project named
        <code>age_calculator</code></div></li>

        <li><div>Give ChatGPT this following guide line:
        <span class="gpt">For future responses, please separate HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript into separate files.</span></div></li>

        <li><div>Ask ChatGPT to create an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        project that will display a person’s age if the user enters
        their birthday.</div></li>

        <li><div>Create a new file in the folder named
        <code>index.html</code> and paste ChatGPT’s HTML code into
        it.</div></li>

        <li><div>Create another new file in the folder for the CSS that
        ChaptGPT wrote. Name this file the same as ChatGPT named
        it.</div></li>

        <li><div>Create another new file in the folder for the
        JavaScript that ChaptGPT wrote. Name this file the same as
        ChatGPT named it.</div></li>

        <li><div>Just as before, you can open the <code>index.html</code>
        file in your browser and test it!</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>What can JavaScript do?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript can add a lot of different things to a website. Use
    ChatGPT to learn about 10 things you can add to a website with
    JavaScript.</p>

    <p><strong>Deliverable: Build something new as a team or improve a
    previous project in this class using Javascript. Use ChatGPT - Be
    creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did.
    Turn in a screenshot, code, or description of what you
    did/improved/deployed as a team and your list of 10 things. Describe
    your personal contribution.</strong></p>
