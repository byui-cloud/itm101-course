    <h1>In-class Activity Week 3 Day 2</h1>
    <h2>Building a Web Site</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Websites use HTML along with JavaScript and CSS to make them
    dynamic. This activity will show how to create linked files to
    include JavaScript on a web page to make it responsive and
    interactive.</p>

    <h3>Approximate Time to Complete</h3>
    <p>45 minutes</p>

    <h3>Different ways to include JavaScript into a website</h3>
    <p>Here are the ways we can add JavaScript to our website.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>Write JavaScript code in our HTML (This is called
        embedding)</div></li>
        <li><div>Create a separate JavaScript file that links to the
        HTML file</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are going to use the second one because it improves
    organization.</p>

    <h3>Organizing files</h3>
    <p>When we link our files together, the computer needs to know where
    to find the files. For this reason, when you create a website, make
    a new folder that will hold your index.html file, along with your
    JavaScript folder.</p>

    <p>Also, now the HTML page will need to know where to find the
    JavaScript. This will use a &lt;script&gt; tag that ChatGPT will set
    up for you. However, you need to be sure to name the JavaScript file
    just like ChatGPT says.</p>

    <h3>Using JavaScript with HTML</h3>
    <p>You’ve already seen basic HTML and used it to create a web page.
    That web page was probably static, meaning the content of the page
    doesn’t change in a web browser. For this activity, you will create
    a web page that uses JavaScript to make the page dynamic.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Create a new folder for this project named
        <code>age_calculator</code></div></li>

        <li><div>Give ChatGPT this following guide line:
        <span class="gpt">For future responses, please separate HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript into separate files.</span></div></li>

        <li><div>Ask ChatGPT to create an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        project that will display a person’s age if the user enters
        their birthday.</div></li>

        <li><div>Create a new file in the folder named
        <code>index.html</code> and paste ChatGPT’s HTML code into
        it.</div></li>

        <li><div>Create another new file in the folder for the CSS that
        ChatGPT wrote. Name this file the same as ChatGPT named
        it.</div></li>

        <li><div>Create another new file in the folder for the
        JavaScript that ChatGPT wrote. Name this file the same as
        ChatGPT named it.</div></li>

        <li><div>Just as before, you can open the <code>index.html</code>
        file in your browser and test it!</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>What can JavaScript do?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript can add a lot of different things to a website. Use
    ChatGPT to learn about 10 things you can add to a website with
    JavaScript.</p>

    <h3>Feasibility Study, Market Analysis and Potential Value</h3>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<p>You are tasked with creating a basic proposal for your team project. Follow the steps below to guide you through the pre-coding process. For each step, provide brief but clear documentation. The aim is to gain an understanding of how planning and business analysis take place before coding starts. Be creative with your software idea&mdash;it can be anything from a simple mobile app to a small web service!</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Why and How: </strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/pN6ZZ51QCPU?si=2fqcny_3H6aniDHe">Feasibility Study of Project - Watch it now or fail later</a></li>
         <div class="video"><iframe
        title="Feasibility Study"
        allowfullscreen referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pN6ZZ51QCPU">
        </iframe></div>    
    <li><strong>Business Deliverable</strong>: Briefly explain why your project is feasible. Estimate the target audience for your software and its potential value in dollars. Who would use your software, and how big is that market? Would you charge for the app? If so, how much would you charge, and how many users would you expect?</li>
    <li>A short paragraph explaining the market potential (size and value), including a basic pricing strategy.</li>
    <li><strong>Tech Deliverable:</strong> Start building the front-end index.html, CSS, and JavaScript using AI for your team project. Use AI - Be
    creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did.
    Turn in a screenshot, code, or description of what you
    did/improved as a team and your list of 10 things. Describe
    your personal contribution.
</ul>

    <h2>Today's Submission</h2>
        <ul>
        <h3>Team Submission:</h3>
        <li><div>Only one person has to turn in the team combined content. </div></li>        
        <li><div>Front-end code generated by AI (index.html, styles.css, Javascript file).</div></li>
        <li><div>Feasibility of project including target audience and why people would want it.</div></li>
        <li><div>Potential value and how much you would charge or how you would make money.</div></li>
        <li><div>Do you have pricing strategies? What about upsells?</div></li>
        <li><div>How many users would you expect?</div></li>
        <li><div>List of 10 things you can do with JavaScript and how you might use those on your project.</div></li>
        <li><div>Turn in the AI generated code and combined code/content from the team for today.</div></li>        

        <h3>Individual Submission:</h3>
        <li><div>Each person still needs to submit an artifact/screenshot and description of
        their personal contribution to the team from today. Each person could turn in their code for the feature they worked on individually.</div></li>
        <li><div>Turn in a screenshot of 'node -v' working or your feature code running in the terminal with node.</div></li>
        </ul>
