    <h2>Week 4 Day 2 In-class Activity</h2>
    <h1>Make Something Cool in the Cloud with Your Team</h1>

    <p>Make something cool and deploy it to firebase - Hackathon style!</p>

    <p><strong>Deliverable: Build something new or improve a previous
    project in this class as a team with Firebase. Use ChatGPT - Be
    creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did.
    Turn in a screenshot, URL, or description of what you
    did/improved/deployed in AWS as a team. Describe your personal
    contribution.</strong></p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only one person has to turn in the code from the team.</li>
        <li>Include a list of everyone’s first and last names in a comment.</li>
        <li>Each person still needs to submit a comment describing their personal contribution.</li>
    </ul>
