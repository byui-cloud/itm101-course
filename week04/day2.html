    <h2>Week 4 Day 2 In-class Activity</h2>
    <h1>Deploy to the Cloud with Your Team</h1>

    <p>In this activity, you will work with your team to deploy a project to the cloud. You will use the skills you have learned in this course to create a project that is feasible, has market potential, and can be built using a suitable technology stack.</p>
    <p>Make something cool and deploy it to the cloud - Hackathon style!</p>
    <p>Use Firebase, AWS, or any other cloud service you like. Use ChatGPT to help you build it.</p>
    <h3>Technology Stack Selection</h3>
    <p>Your team this week will work on a choosing a tech stack!</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Why and How: </strong>Watch this video <a href="https://youtu.be/RTLSSGPoASU?si=lZYOQ31c58850VLl">Picking The Right Technology Stack</a></li>
            <div class="video"><iframe
            title="Technology Stack Selection"
            allowfullscreen referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RTLSSGPoASU">
            </iframe></div>    
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Task</strong>: Consider what technology (programming languages, frameworks) you would use to build it and why. Where will you deploy it?</li>
    <li><strong>Business Deliverable</strong>: A 1-paragraph explanation of basic technology choices including programming languages and a 1-paragraph description of where you will deploy it for hosting to the web/cloud. How many users would you expect? How does that change your deployment strategy?</li>
    
    <a target="_blank" href="assignment-instructions.html#learning-more">Team Activity Technology Ideas</a>
    <p><em>Example</em>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tech Stack Selection</strong>: The project will use existing frameworks for building mobile apps, such as React Native. These will allow for fast development and cross-platform support. The deployment to the cloud will be using Google Firebase Hosting.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Tech Deliverable:</strong> Deploy your project to the cloud. Turn in the URL. You can use Firebase, AWS, or any other cloud service you like.
    Use AI - Be creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did.
    Turn in a screenshot, URL, or description of what you
    did/improved/deployed in the cloud as a team. Describe your personal
    contribution.</li>  
      </ul>  
    <h2>Today's Submission</h2>
        <ul>
        <h3>Team Submission:</h3>
        <li><div>Only one person has to turn in the team combined content. </div></li>        
        <li><div>List the names of those on your team that were here and contributed today. </div></li>        
        <li><div>How many users would you expect? How does that change your deployment strategy?</div></li>
        <li><div>Describe the technology stack you chose and why. </div></li>
        <li><div>Describe where you will deploy it for hosting to the web/cloud. </div></li>
        <li><div>Turn in the AI generated code and combined code/content from the team for today.</div></li>        

        <h3>Individual Submission:</h3>
        <li><div>Each person still needs to submit an artifact/screenshot and description of
        their personal contribution to the team from today. Each person could turn in their code. </div></li>
