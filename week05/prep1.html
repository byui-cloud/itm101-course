    <h1>ITM 101 - Preparation Material Week 5</h1>
    <h2>Attend Devotional</h2>
    <p>You have an upcoming assignment to attend a BYU-Idaho devotional
    at least once this semester - they are every Tuesday at 11 am. Take
    a picture of yourself at the devotional and write something you
    liked from it. Upload the picture and put the text in the comments.
    I would encourage you to go every week to participate in these
    wonderful spiritual feeding opportunities.</p>
