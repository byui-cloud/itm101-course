    <h2>ITM 101 Week 6</h2>
    <h1>Find 5 Alumni or Professonials and Contact at Least One</h1>

    <p>Find a job or an internship that you are interested in (or look
    at the list of 5 you already made in week 1) from indeed.com or
    linkedin.com. Alternatively, make a list of companies that you want
    to work for in the future:

    <p>Either from your company list or your job list, find a BYU-Idaho, BYU alumni, or someone you have a connection to working in that field and reach out to at least one of
    them to find out more about their job and how they got there through
    an informational interview:
