        <h1>Google Firebase Database Website with Authentication</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>In this scenario, you are hired as a cloud consultant to add authentication to improve security to the website created by previous developers. The developers have implemented the code, but you just need to configure the production environment to require authentication on Google Firebase. Limit specific users to be able to edit and view the projects.</p>

        <h3>Business Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Improve security to protect assets</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Use the provided code</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Improve security of the system by adding authentication to Google Firebase (for logging)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Restrict edit access to specific users using the firebase database rules (UID)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Hopefully, you already have a working website connected to the firebase database. If not, follow this tutorial <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://byui-cloud.github.io/itm101-course/week05/assignment-instructions.html">Firebase Website with Database</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="step3">Step 3 - Update firebase database rules</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>To add new projects/data to your database, the rules need to allow <strong>write</strong> or <strong>save</strong> for authenticated users (before we were not authenticated). To fix it, go to the database by clicking on <strong>Firestore Database</strong> and then click on <strong>Rules</strong></p>
                <img src="../site/images/week06/firestore_database.webp" alt="Firestore Database Image">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click in the box to edit it. Change ONLY this one line of code that is there from this (or change the <strong>=</strong> to <strong>!</strong>)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>CHANGE THIS (allow write access if they are not authenticated): <br>

            <li>
                <p>By changing that one line from <strong>==</strong> to <strong>!=</strong>, a <strong>Publish</strong> button should appear. Click <strong>Publish.</strong> It should look like this below</p>

        <h3 id="step4">Step 4 - Download the new code and webpages for authentication</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In Visual Studio Code, open the project we have been working on - it might show up under <strong>Recent.</strong></p>

            <li>
                <p>ChatGPT generated some code, but we also had to add some code and fix some bugs. We are going to just download them and put them in your project to save time and possible variations from ChatGPT and to avoid bugs. If you would like to figure it out on your own, that would be great. </p>
            </li>
            <li>

        <h3 id="step5">Step 5 - Run `firebase deploy` to Firebase Hosting again to save changes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In your Visual Studio Code terminal, type <strong>firebase deploy</strong> (#1 in the image below) and hit <strong>enter</strong> each time as needed to save your changes in your code and push it up to Google Firebase Hosting.</p>
                <img src="../site/images/week05/firebase_deploy.webp" alt="VS Code Firebase Deploy">
            </li>
            <p>It should provide you with the URL for your site in the terminal after you run <strong>firebase deploy</strong> - see the Hosting URL in the red circle above and copy that URL and put it in your browser tab and go to it</p>
            <li>
                <p>Make sure to add the name of your file (ex: cr.html) to the end of the URL like this BUT REPLACE YOUR URL WITH YOURS:
                    https://yourportfolioname.web.app/cr.html</p>
                    <p>// All software and systems should make it so that any content has the ability to Create, Read, Update, Delete = CRUD

                        https://yourportfolioname.web.app/crud.html</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Try logging in and playing with the various webpages above. Have your buddy or someone at your table login with their google account and see how they can edit and delete projects. We need to limit that to specific users in the next step. It should look like this</p>

            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="step6">Step 6 - Secure your website to only allow you to edit and view the projects - by UID</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In Firebase - Firestore Database settings, change your firebase rules to only allow you to edit (write) and view (read) the database. To accomplish this, you need to login to the website of YOUR URL, then get the UID from your Firebase authentication, and then put that UID into your Firestore Database rules.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>First, you need to obtain the UID (unique identifier) of your Google user. Login to your webpage above first so it shows you authenticated as a user</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>https://yourportfolioname.web.app/crud.html (USE YOUR URL instead)</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Obtain the UID</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Click <strong>Firestore Authentication</strong> under <strong>Build</strong> (you may need to expand the <strong>Build</strong> section by clicking on it)</p>

                        <p>That is the unique ID (similar to your social security number or student I-number, but for this Google project). You will put this in your firestore database rules</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>This is what that would look like (BUT REPLACE THE ORANGE TEXT IN THE LIST WITH YOUR UID - notice we added auth.uid in orange):</p>

                              }<br>
                            }

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Test it and see if your user can edit and view projects. Have your buddy or someone at your table see if they can go to your URL and edit the projects</p>

            </li>

                <p>Add a project Name and a Project Description to test the functionality and click <strong>Add Project</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the project is added and appears below the Projects title, you did it!</p>
                <p>Congratulations! You added authentication to Firebase Hosting and a Database and you secured it to your user instead of all Google users!</p>
            </li>

        <h3>If you cannot edit projects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Make sure you are on the crud.html pages and not the page from last week.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> You may need to wait for the firebase rules to finish being applied or clear your cache. If it still doesn</strong>t work, wait a few minutes and do a SHIFT + refresh by pressing SHIFT on your keyboard and click the refresh button in your browser while holding it (that will clear your browser cache)</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>It could be that your database permissions are not working. To fix it, go to the database by clicking on <strong>Firestore Database</strong> and then click on <strong>Rules</strong>. You may need the other rules that have the UID - See <a href="#step6">Step 6</a> for that</p>

        <h3>Permission Errors or firebase installation not working</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>(Mac/Apple) You may need to run the <strong>sudo</strong> command in front of the firebase installation commands and/or other commands in the terminal</p>
                <p>(Windows) You may need to run the terminal commands in a <strong>command prompt</strong> window instead or in powershell.</p>
                <p>(Windows) When you search for <strong>command prompt</strong> click on the <strong>run as administrator</strong> option.</p>

        <h3>Authentication never works</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You might open the inspector in your browser by right-clicking on the web page, but not on an image and select <strong>Inspect</strong></p>
                <p>Click on the Console log. If you get this error - do <a href="#step2">Step 2</a> <strong>Add authentication</strong></p>

            </li>
            <li>Check to see if the styles.css file is in the same folder as the index.html folder or make sure the link to it has the folder listed if needed: <br>
                <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css"&gt;</code>
