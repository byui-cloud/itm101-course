    <h2>ITM 101 Week 6 Day 2 In-class Activity</h2>
    <h1>Risk Assessment</h1>
    <p>As a team, identify potential risks to your project and how you would address them. This is an important part of product management.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Why and How: </strong>Watch this video <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?account=2153100&amp;forceAccount=false&amp;redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fproject-management-foundations-risk-14910484%2Fproject-risk-identification-methods%3Ftrk%3Dshare_video_url%26shareId%3D34MO8l9tSCKhpRF6nSBF9w%253D%253D">Project Risk Identification Methods</a></li>
        <li><strong>Task</strong>: Identify at least two potential risks to the project and how you would address them.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Deliverable</strong>: A short paragraph explaining the risks and possible solutions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Example (You can't use these for your team submission)</em>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Risk 1</strong>: The app may not attract enough users. <strong>Solution</strong>: Create a marketing plan targeting students and professionals through social media.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk 2</strong>: Delays in development due to technical challenges. <strong>Solution</strong>: Schedule buffer time and hire an additional developer if needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Improve Security or Authentication as a team.</h1>

    <ul>
    <li><strong>Tech Deliverable</strong>: Build something new or improve a previous project in
    this class as a team implementing/improving security or
    authentication. Use ChatGPT - Be creative. Have fun. If you fail
    that is ok, turn in what you did. Turn in a screenshot, URL, or
    description of what you did/improved/deployed in AWS as a team.
    Describe your personal contribution.</li>
    </ul>

        <ul>
        <h3>Team Submission:</h3>
        <li><div>Only one person has to turn in the team combined content. </div></li>        
        <li><div>List the names of those on your team that were here and contributed today. </div></li>        
        <li><div>Submit your risks assessment and solutions (minimum of 2 risks and a solution for each).</div></li>

        <h3>Individual Submission:</h3>
        <li><div>Each person still needs to submit an artifact/screenshot and description of
        their personal contribution to the team from today. Each person could turn in their code of their feature before and after code showing it to be more secure. You could have
        each team member sanitize user input on the feature's code. </div></li>
