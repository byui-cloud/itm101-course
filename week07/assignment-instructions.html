        <h1>Create and Deploy a Website from your IDE to a URL</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>In this scenario, you were recently hired by a small startup company that for cybersecurity reasons, they want you to use an IDE in the Cloud. They want to also create a publicly available URL to share the dev website with the client.</p>

        <h3>Business Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Coding in the Cloud for security and Client URL</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and use a Cloud coding editor - IDE (integrated development environment)</li>
            <li>Use the same computing resources as the IDE for the development URL web hosting solution - it doesn’t need to scale automatically</li>
            <li>It does need to be able to manually be scaled up</li>
            <li>Use AWS (Amazon Web Services) if possible</li>
            <li>Use Node.js for deploying the site using a server.js file</li>
            <li>Open necessary firewalls and ports for the website to work for clients who do not have a login to AWS</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="step1">Setting up and logging in to your AWS Academy account</h3>
        <p>Your instructor will create an AWS Academy course that will be used to create sandbox accounts for you as a student. This sandbox account will be an AWS account with a $100 credit assigned to you. There are no requirements for you to purchase or provision any account from AWS. <strong>You will not be required to spend any money or provide credit card information. </strong></p>
        <p>Your instructor has created a user account in the AWS Academy course for you.  As part of the course creation, you will receive an email invitation to join the course.  Please note AWS Academy uses Canvas like I-Learn; however, this is not the same Canvas account as BYUI.  You will be creating new credentials in AWS Academy with your byui.edu email address. If you have previously created an AWS Academy account, you will use those AWS Academy credentials and can skip to step 3 of this section.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>To set up your AWS Academy account, open your email invitation from AWS Academy  (notifications@instructure.com) and click <strong>Get Started.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you don’t see the email, check your junk, spam, or promotional mail folder. </p>
                <img src="../site/images/week07/aws_course_invitation.webp" alt="AWS Course Invitation">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After clicking the <strong>Get Started</strong> button, you will be redirected to a web page for creating an account or login using existing AWS Academy credentials.  Please note that while the email being used is your byui.edu email, this is <strong>not</strong> your byui.edu password.  You should not use the same password for AWS Academy as your byui.edu I-Learn account.  AWS Academy does not utilize single sign-on services and is an entirely separate service and account from byui.edu.  Unless you already have an AWS Academy account, select <strong>Create My Account</strong>.  If you already have an AWS Academy account, select the <strong>I Have a Canvas Account</strong> option and use your AWS Academy credentials to login and accept the invitation to this course. Also, note the AWS Academy Learner Lab number will be different for your course than the [36035] shown below. <strong>This is NOT your I-Learn credentials</strong>.  They are separate accounts.</p>

           <li>
            <p>From the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://awsacademy.instructure.com/login/canvas">LMS dashboard</a>, choose the BYUI AWS Academy Learning Lab for the class you are accessing.  Your instructor will provide a 5 digits identifier for your course to access the learner lab sandbox for your given class. <strong>Note</strong>: If you have been invited to more than one course or Lab, you will see multiple tiles on the dashboard.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>AWS (Amazon Web Service) has Cloud 9, a coding platform that gives you an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). To use Cloud 9, login in to AWS as described previously and search for and click on <strong>Cloud 9</strong>.</p>

        <h3 id="step6">Deploy the Site to the Internet</h3>
        <p>
            To make the website work on the internet, you need some type of service to run the webpage. Some systems servers use node, apache, tomcat, etc. to deploy a webpage/website. We will use Node to accomplish that. Normally, you would set up another EC2 instance, use an S3 bucket, etc. or another server. You would not usually have your source code on the same server as your web application. For simplicity, we will deploy it to the same server as your Cloud9 IDE server/computer.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create one new file called <strong>server.js</strong> that will run the node server. Make sure it is in a folder called <strong>public</strong>.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Use this code to deploy a Node server.js website (make sure to change the IP address of the listening port on the last line to the IP of your internal IP address of the Ec2 instance)</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>To find the IP address of the server, you need the internal IP address THAT YOU WILL PUT ON THE LAST LINE OF THE SERVER.js file. To find that, go back to the AWS webpage you were on when you opened Cloud9. Search for <strong>EC2</strong> (EC2 is where AWS puts the servers/computers that you run, like the one you are running to use Cloud9).  Click on <strong>EC2</strong>.</p>
