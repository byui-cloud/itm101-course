        <h1>Find and Deploy a AI Chat to the Cloud</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>In this scenario, you were recently hired by a small startup company that for privacy and cybersecurity reasons, they want you to build an AI Chat in the Cloud.</span></p>

        <h3>Business Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>AI Chat Privacy</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
        <ul>          
            <li>Find and deploy an AI chat to the cloud (ex: ollama) for the company to use internally without sending any information to the internet</li>
            <li>Use enough resources for it to run well - it doesn’t need to scale automatically</li>
            <li>It does need to be able to manually be scaled up</li>
            <li>Use AWS (Amazon Web Services) if possible</li>
            <li>Use an ollama model that will fit on a server with less than 32 GB of storage space</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project Instructions</h2>

        <h3 id="step1">Setting up and logging in to your AWS Academy account</h3>
        <p>Your instructor will create an AWS Academy course that will be used to create sandbox accounts for you as a student. This sandbox account will be an AWS account with a $50 credit assigned to you. There are no requirements for you to purchase or provision any account from AWS. <strong>You will not be required to spend any money or provide credit card information. </strong></p>
        <p>Your instructor has created a user account in the AWS Academy course for you.  As part of the course creation, you will receive an email invitation to join the course.  Please note AWS Academy uses Canvas like I-Learn; however, this is not the same Canvas account as BYUI.  You will be creating new credentials in AWS Academy with your byui.edu email address. If you have previously created an AWS Academy account, you will use those AWS Academy credentials and can skip to step 3 of this section.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>To set up your AWS Academy account, open your email invitation from AWS Academy  (notifications@instructure.com) and click <strong>Get Started.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you don’t see the email, check your junk, spam, or promotional mail folder. </p>
                <img src="../site/images/week07/aws_course_invitation.webp" alt="AWS Course Invitation">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After clicking the <strong>Get Started</strong> button, you will be redirected to a web page for creating an account or login using existing AWS Academy credentials.  Please note that while the email being used is your byui.edu email, this is <strong>not</strong> your byui.edu password.  You should not use the same password for AWS Academy as your byui.edu I-Learn account.  AWS Academy does not utilize single sign-on services and is an entirely separate service and account from byui.edu.  Unless you already have an AWS Academy account, select <strong>Create My Account</strong>.  If you already have an AWS Academy account, select the <strong>I Have a Canvas Account</strong> option and use your AWS Academy credentials to login and accept the invitation to this course. Also, note the AWS Academy Learner Lab number will be different for your course than the [36035] shown below. <strong>This is NOT your I-Learn credentials</strong>.  They are separate accounts.</p>

                <p>After creating credentials, choose <strong>Student Login</strong> in the future and log in with your email address and password at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://awsacademy.instructure.com">https://awsacademy.instructure.com</a> </p>

        <h3 id="step2">Connecting to AWS Learner Lab</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>
            <p>From the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://awsacademy.instructure.com/login/canvas">LMS dashboard</a>, choose the BYUI AWS Academy Learning Lab for the class you are accessing.  Your instructor will provide a 5 digits identifier for your course to access the learner lab sandbox for your given class. <strong>Note</strong>: If you have been invited to more than one course or Lab, you will see multiple tiles on the dashboard.</p>

        <h3 id="step3">AWS EC2 (Amazon Web Services Elastic Cloud Compute)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> AWS offers many free resources to host your own website: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/webapps/">Check out AWS Free Web Apps</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>AWS (Amazon Web Service) has EC2, the main way to deploy a server with an operating system such as Linux.</p>

                <p>The larger the instance type, the more it costs per hour. You will want to turn this one off if you are not using it. After 4 hours your learner lab will turn it off, but in a normal AWS account it would not turn off unless you turn it off manually.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <strong>Create New Key Pair</strong>. This is the security key you need to connect to the server. It is like a password file.</p>

                        <p><strong>Alternatively</strong>, you could use Powershell or terminal to ssh in with the key you downloaded earlier. You would need to find the public IP of your EC2 instance in the <strong>details</strong> page under <strong>instances</strong> in the EC2 dashboard and run the following command (replace 3.3.3.3 with your public IPV4 address):</p>
                        <pre>ssh -i yourkey.pem ubuntu@3.3.3.3</pre>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Make sure to update the instance often</p>
                <p>This gets and applies the updates for the software and services that need updates</p>
                <pre>sudo yum update</pre>
                <p>This reboots/restarts the server (Only need to do this on kernel or Major OS updates)</p>
                <pre>sudo reboot</pre>
                <p>Reconnect with the steps above after about a minute for the reboot</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="step4">Install ollama (a free Chat AI) </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
              <p>curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh</p>

        <h3>If you can't access AWS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Find the email invite that was sent to your BYU-I email address that ends in @byui.edu</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>You can't see the EC2 instance?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Are you in the correct region? Did you click on the top right corner of AWS to connect to the Oregon region</p>
            </li>
