    <p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>
    <p>In this scenario, you were recently hired by a small startup company that for privacy and cybersecurity reasons, they want you to build an AI Chat in the Cloud.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h5><strong>Business Requirements:</strong></h5>
    <ul>
        <li>AI Chat Privacy</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Project Requirements:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Find and deploy an AI chat to the cloud (ex: ollama) for the company to use internally without sending any information to the internet</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use enough resources for it to run well - it doesn&rsquo;t need to scale automatically</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>It does need to be able to manually be scaled up</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use AWS (Amazon Web Services) if possible</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use an ollama model that will fit on a server with less than 32 GB of storage space</strong></li>
    </ul>
