    <h1>Web App Ideas</h1>

    <h2>Monetization</h2>
    <p>The web page or web app that you build for any of the ideas below
    could include advertisements from amazon.com or some other retailer
    for items related to the content of the web page.</p>

    <h2>No Storage</h2>
    <p>Here are some ideas for static web pages that use no storage.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>A web page that describes the purpose and allowed
        movements for all the pieces on a chess board</div></li>

        <li><div>A web page that defines common terms in the sport
        cricket</div></li>

        <li><div>A web page that lists the provinces of Canada and their
        capital cities</div></li>

        <li><div>A web page that contains a summary of each chapter of
        the Book of Mormon</div></li>

        <li><div>A web page that describes trees commonly found in
        Idaho</div></li>

        <li><div>A web app that computes a person’s age from her
        birthday or that computes the years, months, and days elapsed
        between two dates</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>A static web app is one that has no functionality on the the
    server. However, it does include JavaScript code that executes in
    the browser.</p>

    <p>Here are some ideas for static web apps that use only the
    browser’s local storage or else no storage at all.</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>A web app that plays tic tac toe. The app could have
        two modes: (1) one player mode where the computer plays against
        one player and (2) two player mode where two players play
        against each other. The app could store the number of wins for
        each play in the browser’s local storage.</div></li>

        <li><div>A web app that plays rock paper scissors with one
        player. The app could have two modes: (1) the computer randomly
        chooses rock paper or scissors each time and (2) the computer
        tracks the human player’s previous choices and tries to win by
        choosing rock paper or scissors based on the human player’s
        previous choices. The app could store the number of wins and
        losses in the browser’s local storage.</div></li>

        <li><div>A web app that allows a person to record the date and
        number of steps that she walked each day and lists all the steps
        along with the total number of steps for each month.</div></li>

        <li><div>A web app that allows an athlete to record the date and
        distance of his daily bicycle ride in the browser’s local
        storage and that lists all the distances along with the total
        distance for each month.</div></li>

        <li><div>A web app with two buttons: "Start Timer" and "Stop
        Timer" that records the time a person spends on an activity</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Database in the Cloud</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Clock-in and clock-out with authentication and employee
        and manager roles</div></li>

        <li><div>Allows multiple employees to record their expenses and
        allows a manager to see all the expenses</div></li>

        <li><div>Ministering interactions</div></li>

        <li><div>An app that allows people to record seeing an animal or
        plant</div></li>

        <li><div>Music playlists with a three collections: artists,
        songs, and playlists</div></li>
    </ol>
