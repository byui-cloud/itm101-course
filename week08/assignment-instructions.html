        <h1>AWS Website to S3</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In this scenario, you found a job or internship that you want to apply for. In the job description, they have a MINIMUM requirement of S3 knowledge. You noticed they PREFER candidates who have experience with hosting websites in S3 buckets and can deploy code to the bucket. To build your resume, you will put code into an S3 bucket and make the website public directly from the S3 bucket.</p>

        <h3>Business Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><div>
                Auto scaling web system for many users
            </div></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><div>
                <p>Deploy a web application to an AWS S3 (autoscaling) bucket directly from your computer</p>
                <p>Normally, you would also use AWS Cloudfront for autoscaling too but we won't do that</p>
            </div></li>
            <li><div>Use AWS (Amazon Web Services) and S3 Buckets</div></li>
            <li><div>Open necessary firewalls and ports for the website to work for clients who do not have a login to AWS</div></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>You might want to delete the EC2 instance from last week if you didn't yet. We won't use it again and it will cost every time you turn on your learner lab. Go terminate/delete it.</h2>

        <h4>WHEN YOU MAKE THE BUCKET IT MUST HAVE YOUR NAME IN IT (at least your first or last name)</h4>

            </div></li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="step3">Select the Region</h3>
        <p>To access various resources in AWS like an S3 bucket (a network file storage system similar to your hard drive on your computer, but available on the internet), you can do this directly using AWS. First select the location (region) nearest to you.</p>
        <p>Change your region to <strong>US West</strong> by clicking on the <strong>N. Virginia</strong> near the top right corner of your browser. This change to the Oregon computer/servers that we deployed in Oregon will be found, which is physically closer to Idaho. </p>

    ]

            </div></li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="step8">HTTP vs HTTPS (the ‘S’ is secure = it is encrypted)</h3>
        <p>For your website to be secure, you need to add an SSL certificate and AWS requires Cloudfront distribution on top of the S3 bucket if you want https. Because we aren’t using Cloudfront, you have to use http (not https).</p>
        <p>We will load our site with http:// (not https://). Passwords would be visible on the network by using http. This is a big security problem. Don’t add authentication to this scenario.</p>

        <h3 id="step9">Website URL</h3>
        <p>The URL of your site should be something like this:</p>
        <p>http://yourbucketname.s3.amazonaws.com</p>

        <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting & Common Problems</h2>
        <h3>If the webpage doesn't load</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><div>You may need to add the bucket policy</div></li>
            <li><div>Make sure to replace the bucket name in the bucket policy</div></li>
            <li><div>Did you use http:// instead of https://</div></li>
            <li><div>Did you make the bucket public</div></li>
        </ul>
