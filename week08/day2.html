    <h2>ITM 101 In-class Activity Week 8 Day 2</h2>
    <h1>What is AWS Amplify?</h1>
    <p>AWS Amplify automates the deployment of many systems in AWS and is similar to Firebase. You can upload a folder like you could to an S3 bucket, but it does all the S3 bucket set up and configuration for you. Amplify is a set of tools from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps front-end developers build full-stack applications on AWS. It integrates various AWS services and tools into a framework that abstracts away cloud infrastructure complexity. This allows developers to focus on the user experience (UX) while leaving application infrastructure to the cloud provider.</p>
    <h3>Part 1 - Everyone upload a web page to Amplify</h3>
    <p>Amplify is very simple to use. You zip up a website into a folder on your computer. Open Amplify in your AWS console and select your zipped folder.</p>
    <p>Everyone turn in your own Amplify link of your zipped up folder.</p>
    <h3>Part 2 - Create something cool in AWS with S3, Amplify, or both as a team.</h3>
    <p><strong>Deliverable: Build something new or improve a previous project in this class as a team with AWS S3 buckets or AWS Amplify. Use ChatGPT - Be creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did. Turn in a screenshot, URL, or description of what you did/improved/deployed in AWS as a team. Describe your personal contribution. </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>Only one person has to turn in the code from the team.</div></li>
        <li><div>Include a list of everyone's first and last names in a comment.</div></li>
        <li><div>Each person still needs to submit a comment describing their personal contribution and turn in their own Amplify link that they did individually.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>You might want to delete the EC2 instance from last week if you didn't yet. We won't use it again and it will cost every time you turn on your learner lab. Go terminate/delete it.</h2>
