    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Week 8 Day 2</h1>
    <h2>What is AWS Amplify?</h2>
    <p>AWS Amplify automates the deployment of many systems in AWS and is similar to Firebase. You can upload a folder like you could to an S3 bucket, but it does all the S3 bucket set up and configuration for you. Amplify is a set of tools from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps front-end developers build full-stack applications on AWS. It integrates various AWS services and tools into a framework that abstracts away cloud infrastructure complexity. This allows developers to focus on the user experience (UX) while leaving application infrastructure to the cloud provider.</p>
    <h2>Part 1 - Everyone upload a webpage to Amplify</h2>
    <p>Amplify is very simple to use. You zip up a website into a folder on your computer. Open Amplify in your AWS console and select your zipped folder.</p>
    <p>Everyone turn in your own Amplify link of your zipped up folder.</p>
    <h2>Part 2 - Create something cool in AWS with S3, Amplify, or both as a team.</h2>
    <p><strong>Deliverable: Build something new or improve a previous project in this class as a team with AWS S3 buckets or AWS Amplify. Use ChatGPT - Be creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did. Turn in a screenshot, URL, or description of what you did/improved/deployed in AWS as a team. Describe your personal contribution. </strong></p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only one person has to turn in the code from the team.</li>
        <li>Include a list of everyone's first and last names in a comment.</li>
        <li>Each person still needs to submit a comment describing their personal contribution and turn in their own Amplify link that they did individually.</li>
    </ul>
