    <h2>ITM 101 In-class Activity Week 8 Day 2</h2>
    <p>Today, you will complete a cost analysis and a deploy the front-end to Amplify and/or to an S3 bucket.</p>
    <h1>Cost Analysis</h1>  
    <p>As a team, determine how much it will cost to create a final product, including monthly costs. You can use this for your final presentation.</p>  
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Why and How: </strong>Watch this video <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?account=2153100&amp;forceAccount=false&amp;redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fproject-management-foundations-15528659%2Festimate-time-and-cost%3Ftrk%3Dshare_video_url%26shareId%3DglaUa7klSmykCD38DYrNlA%253D%253D">Estimate Time and Cost (3 min)</a></li>
        <li><strong>Task</strong>: Provide a basic estimate of the development costs. Think about the number of people you might need, their salaries or hourly rates, and any software or hardware costs. You can make educated guesses.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Deliverable</strong>: A bullet-point list of estimated costs (development, technology, overhead).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Example</em>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cost Estimation</strong>:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Developer salaries (2 developers, 3 months): $30,000</li>
            <li>Designer salary (1 designer, 2 months): $10,000</li>
            <li>Software licenses: $1,000</li>
            <li>Monthly AWS (EC2, MYSQL, S3, Amplify) or Firebase Costs ...</li>
            <li>Marketing: $2,000</li>
            <li>Total: $43,000</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>What is AWS Amplify?</h1>
    <p><strong>Each person on the team needs to do Amplify individually today. </strong>Help your team. Then, build some of your front-end in AWS.</p>
    <p>AWS Amplify automates the deployment of many systems in AWS and is similar to Firebase. You can upload a folder like you could to an S3 bucket, but it does all the S3 bucket set up and configuration for you. </p><p>Amplify is a set of tools from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps front-end developers build full-stack applications on AWS. It integrates various AWS services and tools into a framework that abstracts away cloud infrastructure complexity. This allows developers to focus on the user experience (UX) and code while leaving application infrastructure to the cloud provider.</p>

    <h3>Part 1 - Everyone upload a web page to Amplify</h3>
    <p>Amplify is very simple to use. You zip up a website into a folder on your computer. Open Amplify in your AWS console and select your zipped folder.</p>
    <p>Everyone turn in your own Amplify link of your zipped up folder. Your name must be in the URL.</p>
    <h3>Part 2 - Deploy your front-end code in AWS with S3, Amplify, or both as a team.</h3>
    <p><strong>Tech Deliverable: Build something new or improve a previous project in this class as a team with AWS S3 buckets or AWS Amplify. Use ChatGPT - Be creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did. Turn in a screenshot, URL, or description of what you did/improved/deployed in AWS as a team. Describe your personal contribution. </strong></p>
    
    <h2>Today's Submission</h2>
    <p>For the teamwork today, put your front-end code (HTML, CSS, and Front-end JavaScript) in AWS S3 or Amplify.</p>
    <p>Each person could work on improving the CSS and UX to make your site look nicer.</p>
    <p>If you installed Node.js on an EC2 last week, try and connect to it.</p>
    <p>Ask AI: How can you connect front-end code in an S3 bucket directly to a node.js back-end in AWS ec2?</p>    
    <ul>
    <h3>Team Submission:</h3>
    <li><div>Only one person has to turn in the team combined content. </div></li>        
    <li><div>List the names of those on your team that were here and contributed today. </div></li>        
    <li><div>Submit what you built as a team.</div></li>
    <li><div>Submit something about S3, Amplify, or how you put your front-end code in AWS or connected it to the back-end.</div></li>
    <li><div>Turn in the AI generated code and combined code/content from the team for today.</div></li>        

    <h3>Individual Submission:</h3>
    <li><div>Each person needs to submit their own Amplify URL with your own name in the URL and working or a screenshot of it working. Also, an artifact/screenshot and description of
    your personal contribution to the team from today. Each person could connect the front-end code to the back-end. </div></li>
    </ul>        
    
    <li><div>Each person still needs to submit a comment describing their personal contribution and turn in their own Amplify link that they did individually.</div></li>

    <h2>You might want to delete the EC2 instance from last week if you didn't yet. We won't use it again and it will cost every time you turn on your learner lab. Go terminate/delete it.</h2>
