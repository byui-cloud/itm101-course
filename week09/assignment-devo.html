    <h1>ITM 101 Week 9 - Attend Devotional at Least Once this Semester</h1>
    <p>Attend Devotional at the BYU-Idaho I-Center at least once in-person this semester. Devoationals are every Tuesday at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>Take a picture of yourself at the devotional and write something you liked from it. Upload the picture and put the text in the comments. I would encourage you to go every week to participate in these wonderful spiritual feeding opportunities.</p>
