    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Week 9 Day 2</h1>
    <p>Today, your team will focus on System Design, including UX design, user testing, and good backup strategies.</p>
    <h2>System Design (UX)</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Why and How:</strong> Watch this video <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/interaction-design-projects-and-platforms/user-research-overview?autoSkip=true&resume=false">&nbsp;Designing Software and Web Applications (3 min)</a></li>

        <li><strong>Task</strong>: Sketch out a basic design for the software including wireframes, outlining its main components or screens (high-level system design). You can create a simple flowchart or diagram.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Deliverable</strong>: A simple diagram or flowchart showing how the app or software is structured (can be hand-drawn or done using wireframe software).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Upgrade, Backup, and Restore</h2>
    <p>Part of a good system design also includes regular backups to restore to if necessary.</p>
    <p>Some of the benefits of VMs or virtualized machines/servers in
    the cloud are the abilities to add processing power, RAM, and
    storage and to make backups (snapshots), and to restore from
    snapshots.</p>

    <p>Each person individually needs to do the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Add more RAM to your EC2 instance.</div></li>
        <li><div>Start your EC2 instance and connect to it.</div></li>
        <li><div>Using the AWS Console in your browser, create a snapshot. Now we have a backup.</div></li>
        <li><div>Now, let's simulate a hacker creating a file on your server: Using the connected terminal, create or download a file (ex: touch hackerfile.sh).</div></li>
        <li><div>Using the AWS Console, restore the snapshot:</div></li>
        <ol>
            <li><div>Stop the EC2 instance.</div></li>
            <li><div>Detach its current volume.</div></li>
            <li><div>From the snapshot, create a volume <strong>in
            the same availability zone as the previously current
            volume</strong>.</div></li>
            <li><div>Attach the new volume to the EC2 instance.</div></li>
            <li><div>Start the EC2 instance.</div></li>
        </ol>
        </div></li>
        <li><div>Connect to your EC2 instance and verify that the
        file was removed.</div></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Help your team. Take screenshots or make a video to turn in.</p>

    <h2>Today's Submission</h2>
    <p>For the teamwork today, focus on UX. Create some wireframes. Use AI and CSS to improve the look of your website. Improve mobile design or add accessibility designs.</p>
    <p>Each person could work on improving the CSS and UX to make your site look nicer. Do you have aria labels, alt tags, things for screen readers? Have someone show it to another table and obtain feedback.</p>
    <p>Ask AI: How can I improve my code for UX, including accessibilty?</p>    
    <ul>
    <h3>Team Submission:</h3>
    <li><div>Only one person has to turn in the team combined content. </div></li>        
    <li><div>List the names of those on your team that were here and contributed today. </div></li>        
    <li><div>Submit what you built as a team.</div></li>
    <li><div>Did you do user testing? Have another table try your page. What feedback did you obtain?</div></li>    
    <li><div>Submit something of how you improved the front-end code to improve UX and then deploy it to AWS.</div></li>
    <li><div>Turn in the AI generated code and combined code/content from the team for today.</div></li>        

    <h3>Individual Submission:</h3>
    <li><div>Each person needs to submit their own screenshots of a backup and hacker file with your own name in in it and screenshots of it. Also, an artifact/screenshot and description of
    your personal contribution to the team from today. Each person could improve the CSS or front-end code. </div></li>
    </ul>
