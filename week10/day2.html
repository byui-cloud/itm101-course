    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Week 10 Day 2</h1>
    <h2>Docker</h2>
    <p>Docker is a virtualization tool to containerize apps. Pick something from <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker hub</a> and deploy it.</p>

    <p>Create something cool with Docker to add to your team project.</p>

    <p><strong>Tech Deliverable: Build something new with docker as a team with AWS or Firebase. Finish something from the backlog. Use ChatGPT - Be creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did. Turn in a screenshot, URL, or description of what you did/improved/deployed as a team. Describe your personal contribution.</strong></p>
    <h3>Turn in screenshots or a video of what you have done and/or where you are stuck.</h3>

    <h2>Project Management</h2>

    <h3>Use Project Management Methodologies Today - Scrum agile stand-up meeting</h3>
    <p>Teams often use project management methodologies to ensure the project progresses. Daily stand-up meetings is one way to accomplish it.</p>
    <p>Practice a daily stand up half way through the assignment today.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>First, each team member set a 'sprint' goal of what you will accomplish for the first half of class.</div></li>
        <li><div>Half way through the teamwork time, stop and answer these questions:
        <ol>
            <li><div>What did you work on yesterday (assume that 'yesterday' is the first half of class)?</div></li>
            <li><div>What are you going to work on today (assume that 'today' is the last half of class)?</div></li>
            <li><div>What issues are blocking you (what are the blockers)?</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Today's Submission</h2>
    <p>For the teamwork today, focus on Docker. What docker container could you add to your project?</p>    
    <p>Someone could finish the backlog of tasks not completed from last week.</p>
    <ul>
    <h3>Team Submission:</h3>
    <li><div>Only one person has to turn in the team combined content. </div></li>        
    <li><div>List the names of those on your team that were here and contributed today. </div></li>        
    <li><div>Submit what you built as a team.</div></li>
    <li><div>What docker container did you add?</div></li>    
    <li><div>Submit something of how you improved your project and deploy it to AWS.</div></li>
    <li><div>Turn in the AI generated code and combined code/content from the team for today.</div></li>        

    <h3>Individual Submission:</h3>
    <li><div>Each person needs to submit your 'Sprint goal' and screenshots of what you completed on it. Also, an artifact/screenshot and description of
    your personal contribution to the team from today. Each person submit what you did the first half and last half of class. </div></li>
    <li><div>What blockers did you have?</div></li>
    <li><div>Submit a comment on how your daily stand-up went and what you think about it.</div></li>
    </ul>
