    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Week 10 Day 2</h1>
    <p>Create something cool in AWS as a team.</p>
    <p><strong>Deliverable: Build something new or improve a previous project in this class as a team with AWS or Firebase. Use ChatGPT - Be creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did. Turn in a screenshot, URL, or description of what you did/improved/deployed as a team. Describe your personal contribution. </strong></p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only one person has to turn in the code from the team.</li>
        <li>Include a list of everyone's first and last names in a comment.</li>
        <li>Each person still needs to submit a comment describing their personal contribution.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Not sure what to do? You could pick one of these or pick one you didn't do last week:</p>

    <h2>AWS Options</h2>
    <p>(Some of these tutorial require you to use terminal commands using Amplify CLI, similar to "amplify ...", those will not work in our education version. 
        You will need to make a personal AWS account or use Amplify through the Web Interface and some parts may not be feasible to complete.)</p>
