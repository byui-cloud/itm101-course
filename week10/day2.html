    <h2>Docker</h2>

    <p>Create something cool with Docker.</p>

    <h3>Use Project Management Methodologies Today - Scrum agile stand-up meeting</h3>
    <p>Teams often use project management methodologies to ensure the project progresses. Daily stand-up meetings is one way to accomplish it.</p>
    <p>Practice a daily stand up half way through the assignment today.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>First, each team member set a 'sprint' goal of what you will accomplish for the first half of class.</div></li>
        <li><div>Half way through the teamwork time, stop and answer these questions:
        <ol>
            <li><div>What did you work on yesterday (assume that 'yesterday' is the first half of class)?</div></li>
            <li><div>What are you going to work on today (assume that 'today' is the last half of class)?</div></li>
            <li><div>What issues are blocking you (what are the blockers)?</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Deliverable: Build something new with docker as a team with AWS or Firebase. Use ChatGPT - Be creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did. Turn in a screenshot, URL, or description of what you did/improved/deployed as a team. Describe your personal contribution.</strong></p>
    <h3>Turn in screenshots or a video of what you have done and/or where you are stuck.</h3>
    <h3>Also post a comment on how your daily stand-up went and what you think about it.</h3>
