    <h3>What is Docker?</h3>
    <p>Docker allows you to have something contained on your server. It is kind of like an 'app' but it usually has a really small Linux running it with an application or services installed on it.</p>
    <p>They can be easily added or removed without affecting the host server.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Watch this Video about Docker:</p>
