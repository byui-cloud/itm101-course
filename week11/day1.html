    <h1>ITM 101 In-class Activity Week 11 Day 1 - Build Your Resume with a Cloud Project</h1>
    <p><strong>Deliverable:</strong> Look at your list of personal projects from the five jobs you found on the internet (you did this in week 1 or find some internships you want soon). Pick a project that you want to start on. Build something new or improve something in AWS or Firebase that might be a resume item. It doesn't have to be AWS or Firebase but some technical project you want to put on your resume. Ideally, do something related to the cloud.</p>
    <p>Use ChatGPT - Be creative. Have fun. If you fail that is ok, turn in what you did. <strong>Turn in a screenshot, URL, and a description of what you did/deployed. Submit the bullet item you would put on your resume as if you had finished the project (if you aren't done). Put the description and bullet point resume item in the comments or a document.</strong></p>
