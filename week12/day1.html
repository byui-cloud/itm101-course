        <h1>Create and Deploy with Terraform</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Using Terraform, you could have deployed <a href="https://byui-cloud.github.io/itm101-course/week09/assignment-instructions.html">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://byui-cloud.github.io/itm101-course/week10/assignment-instructions.html">Part 2</a> from previous weeks with Terraform.</p>
        <p>Terraform allows you to quickly deploy a Linux Server, an app, a database, a docker, and more, all in one file.</p>
        <p>Check out all the servers and 'apps' you can deploy with Terraform: <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/">https://registry.terraform.io/</a></p>
        
        <h2>Business Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Create an EC2 instance using Terraform that can be deployed in the west region</p>
                <p>The company wants a consitent 'recipe' or terraform script that documents how things were set up.</p>            
            </li>

        <h2 id="part3">Part 3 - Terraform</h2>
        <h3 id="step9">Setting Up an EC2 Instance - Using Automation</h3>
        <p>Terraform scripts allow you to deploy everything from <a href="https://byui-cloud.github.io/itm101-course/week09/assignment-instructions.html">Part 1 of EC2 instances and also Part 2 with Docker</a> in one file.</p>
        <h3>AWS Cloudshell (Amazon's terminal/shell) to use Terraform to deploy systems/servers</h3>
        <p>Now, let’s deploy the same thing but with automated scripts like Terraform in another region of what we previously installed in prior weeks.</p>
        <p><strong> DO NOT USE THE LINUX terminal. DO NOT USE THE LEARNER LAB terminal. Use the Cloudshell.</strong></p>
        <p>We are using AWS cloudshell. That is Linux too, but it is to deploy resources in your AWS.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>AWS Cloudshell allows terminal/command prompt access to quickly run scripts for deployment.</p>
                <p>To open <strong>Cloudshell</strong>, click on the <strong>Cloudshell</strong> icon at the top of the screen or at the bottom left of the screen.</p>
                <p>A black window will appear as a terminal at the bottom of your screen. Paste your commands in that window.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="step10">AWS Terraform</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Make sure you look at the region you are in at the <strong>top right</strong>. (ex: N. Virginia)</p>
                <p>The Terraform script we will use <strong>ONLY WORKS IN N. Virginia</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Install Terraform by opening the Cloudshell and run these <strong>one by one (they will not work all together)</strong></p>
                <p><strong>DO THESE IN CLOUDSHELL! NOT IN THE LINUX INSTANCE!</strong></p>
                <p>Terraform allows you automatically deploy servers in AWS and other systems too. They are automated scripts. First you need to install Terraform with these three commands - DO THEM ONE BY ONE:</p>
                <pre>sudo yum install -y yum-utils</pre>
                <pre>sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo</pre>
                <pre>sudo yum -y install terraform</pre>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="step11">Terraform Script File</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the same AWS Cloudshell terminal, get a terraform file we made:</p>
                <p><strong>MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE N. Virginia REGION!</strong></p>
                <pre>curl -O https://byui-cloud.github.io/itm101-course/week12/mainawslinuxeast.tf</pre>
                <p>Terraform has <strong>.tf</strong> files that have instructions on where to deploy the server, which settings, what firewall settings, how many resources, etc. We made this file above for you to deploy a basic Linux server.</p>
                <p>Go look at the file: <a href="https://byui-cloud.github.io/itm101-course/week12/mainawslinuxeast.tf">https://byui-cloud.github.io/itm101-course/week12/mainawslinuxeast.tf</a></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="step12">Initiate Terraform Script File</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Start the terraform.</p>
                <pre>terraform init</pre>
                <pre>terraform plan</pre>
                <pre>terraform apply -auto-approve</pre>
                <pre>ls</pre>
                <p><strong>terraform apply</strong> deploys the resources (it uses the .tf)</p>
                <p>The .tf file that we provided generates a .pem file in your cloudshell terminal.</p>
                <p>You can download it if you want on the <strong>Actions</strong> menu.</p>
                <p><strong>ls</strong> displays the files and folders in the current working directory. See the .pem file that was made.</p>
                <p>Now go look at the AWS Linux ec2 instance that was deployed. Remote into it with the key that was created in the same shell.</p>
                <p>Find the public IPv4 address on the EC2 instance (replace 3.3.3.3 with yours). Connect via ssh.</p>
                <pre>ssh -i private_key.pem ec2-user@3.3.3.3</pre>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Part 4 - AI Chat deployed with Terraform</h2>
        <h3>Business Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Deploy an AWS AI Web-based Chat on AWS using terraform</p>
            </li>
        </ul>  
        <h3 id="part4">Use Terraform to Deploy AI Chat</h3>      
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Use terrform to deploy the EC2 with 32 GB of hard drive space, a t2.large instance, AWS Linux.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use and download the tf file below and that will run terraform using the new file:</p>
                <p>The new file has some scripts in it that downloads and installs Docker, modifies some ai ip address variables, etc. </p>
                <p>Go look at the file as a team and talk about what it is doing: <a href="https://byui-cloud.github.io/itm101-course/week12/mainawslinuxeastAI.tf"></a>https://byui-cloud.github.io/itm101-course/week12/mainawslinuxeastAI.tf</p>
                <p>You need to download the tf file and run terraform with it. (If you didn't finish the first part using the first .tf file, this one may not work)</p>
                <p><strong>MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE N. Virginia REGION!</strong></p>
                <pre>curl -O https://byui-cloud.github.io/itm101-course/week12/mainawslinuxeastAI.tf</pre>
                <p>Make sure to initiate the terraform script (see steps above if needed).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>      

        <h3 id="step13">Deleting Resources With Terraform Script File</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Go back to your Cloudshell and run this to delete all the resources:</p>
                <pre>terraform destroy -auto-approve</pre>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="step14">Ending Session & Managing Budget</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Make sure to stop your instances and <strong>End your Learner Lab</strong> to save on budget when you are done working on it for that day/class. If you <strong>terminate</strong> your instance, it will delete it. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="learning-more">Learning More</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Check out all the servers and 'apps' you can deploy with Terraform on the registry. Find and try one: <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/">https://registry.terraform.io/</a></p>
                <p>Combine Terraform and docker. Install more things and do more with docker and terraform. You can install docker with a terraform script. You put it in a "user_data" section of the tf file. Look at the mainawslinuxeastAI.tf file.</p>
                <pre>sudo yum install -y docker</pre>
                <p>(find a docker container to install: https://hub.docker.com/ ex: https://hub.docker.com/r/langchain/langchain)(ex: sudo docker pull langchain/langchain)</p>
                <pre>sudo docker pull _________</pre>
                <pre>sudo systemctl enable docker</pre>
                <pre>sudo service docker start</pre>
                <pre>sudo docker run --name myllm -d --restart unless-stopped langchain/langchain</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Automate things further with a linux script. Use AI as needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Connect via that instance above with RDP.</p>
                <p>Install remote desktop beta on your laptop or use the built in one for Windows.</p>
                <p>SSH into the server and set the password for the ec2-user and enable RDP:</p>
                <p>sudo passwd ec2-user</p>
                <p>sudo openssl req -x509 -sha384 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -subj "/C=US/ST=ID/L=Rexburg/O=B/CN=www.example.com" -keyout /etc/xrdp/key.pem -out /etc/xrdp/cert.pem -days 365
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
