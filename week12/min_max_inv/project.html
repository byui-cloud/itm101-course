<h1>ITM 101 Final Project</h1>
<p class="subtitle">(Min-Max Inventory System)</p>

<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>Many companies have a storeroom or warehouse where they temporarily
store items that they will sell or use to manufacture products. The
items in a storeroom or warehouse are called <dfn>inventory</dfn>.</p>

<p>An <dfn>inventory system</dfn> is a computer system used by employees
to track items in a storeroom or warehouse. The employees must track the
inventory so that they know what items are available and what items need
to be ordered from a manufacturer. Companies want to store the right
amount of items in their warehouse. They want to store enough of all
items so that they can continue to manufacture products or sell to
customers. But storing more of an item than the company needs is costly
to the company.</p>

<p>A <dfn>min-max inventory system</dfn> is a simple inventory system
used by businesses to manage their inventory levels efficiently. In a
min-max inventory system, a company chooses a minimum (min) and maximum
(max) quantity for each item in inventory. When the current quantity of
an item drops to the minimum threshold, the system automatically
generates a reorder to bring the quantity back up to the maximum
level.</p>

<p>Your boss has asked you to create and deploy a min-max inventory
system that uses a NoSQL database in the Internet Cloud.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<p>Do the following:</p>
<ol class="long">
    <li><div>Use ChatGPT to learn about Google Firestore, what it is,
    and the steps a program must follow to use a Firestore database.
    Start a new chat with ChatGPT, and give the following prompts to
    ChatGPT. Use ChatGPT as a learning assistant. Read it’s answers, and
    ask it other questions that will help you understand Google
    Firestore and how to use it.
    <ol>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is a Google Firestore
        database?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How many companies use Firestore
        databases?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How does a Firestore database organize
        data?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">I’m going to ask you more questions about
        the Google Firestore database service. If you write any code as
        part of your answers, always write HTML and JavaScript code that
        uses Google’s Web modular API.</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">What steps do I need to complete to create
        a Google Firebase project with a Firestore database that can be
        read and written by a JavaScript web application?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">What do I need to do to write a web app
        that uses a Firestore database?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">What steps are needed in a JavaScript web
        app to add a document to a Firestore database?</div></li>
    </ol>
    </div></li>

    <li><div>Use the
    <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase Console</a>
    to create a new Firebase project named “min-max-inventory”.</div></li>

    <li><div>Still using the Firebase Console, add a web app to your
    Firebase min-max-inventory project.</div></li>

    <li><div>Still using the Firebase Console, enable
    Hosting.</div></li>

    <li><div>Still using the Firebase Console, add a Firestore database
    to your Firebase project. Your new Firestore database should use
    open or development rules.</div></li>

    <li><div>In your Firestore database, initialize a collection named
    “suppliers” by doing the following:
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Give this prompt to ChatGPT:
        <p class="gpt">Please generate a list of 5 fictitious product
        suppliers in JSON format. Each item in the list must include
        three attributes:  a supplier name, email address, and phone
        number. Choose names that would fit into an animated cartoon
        like Wile E Coyote and the Roadrunner, Space Jam, and Roger
        Rabbit.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Wait for ChatGPT to respond and then give it this
        prompt:
        <p class="gpt">Please write HTML and JavaScript code in a single
        HTML file that will add the supplier data that you generated for
        the 5 suppliers into a Google Firestore database. The HTML must
        import the Firebase and Firestore Web modular API as scripts of
        type="module". The JavaScript code must be contained in a
        function that a browser will execute after the HTML document is
        loaded. The JavaScript code must use the Firebase and Firestore
        Web modular API functions to add the supplier data into a
        collection named "suppliers". After adding each supplier, the
        JavaScript code must retrieve the document ID for the supplier
        and display the document ID and supplier name in a div in the
        HTML document.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Wait for ChatGPT to respond. Then copy the code that
        ChatGPT wrote and paste it into a new file.</div></li>

        <li><div>Save the file as init_suppliers_gpt.html</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the init_suppliers_gpt.html file in a browser, and
        your browser should add five suppliers to a collection named
        "suppliers" in your Firestore database. The browser window
        should now have a list of five supplier IDs and names.</div></li>

        <li><div>Copy the five supplier IDs into a new file in VS
        Code.</div></li>

        <li><div>Using the Firebase console, verify that your Firestore
        database has a collection named "suppliers" that contains five
        documents.</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Initialize a collection named “products” in your Firestore
    database by doing the following:
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Copy the following prompt and paste it at the top of
        the file in VS Code that contains the five supplier IDs from the
        previous step.
        <p class="gpt">Please generate a list of 20 products for a
        min-max inventory system for the cosmetics industry. Generate
        the list in JSON format. Each item in the list must include five
        attributes: a product name, minimum quantity, quantity, maximum
        quantity, and supplier ID. Use these supplier IDs: </p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Review the prompt and ensure that it makes sense. Then
        give the prompt to ChatGPT.</div></li>

        <li><div>After ChatGPT responds, give it this prompt:
        <p class="gpt">Please write HTML and JavaScript code in a single
        HTML file that will add the product data that you generated into
        a Google Firestore database. The HTML must import the Firebase
        and Firestore Web modular API as scripts of type="module". The
        JavaScript code must be contained in a function that a browser
        will execute after the HTML document is loaded. The JavaScript
        code must use the Firebase and Firestore Web modular API
        functions to add the product data into a collection named
        "products". After adding each product, the JavaScript code must
        display the document ID and product name for the product in a
        div in the HTML document.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Wait for ChatGPT to respond. Then copy the code that
        ChatGPT wrote and paste it into a new file.</div></li>

        <li><div>Save the file as <code>init_products_gpt.html</code></div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>init_products_gpt.html</code> file in a
        browser, and your browser should add 20 products to a collection
        named "products" in your Firestore database. The browser window
        should now have a list of 20 product IDs and names.</div></li>

        <li><div>Using the Firebase console, verify that your Firestore
        database has a collection named "products" that contains 20
        documents.</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Using a browser on your computer, download and install
    NodeJS from
    <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">https://nodejs.org/en/download</a></div></li>

    <li><div>On your computer create a new folder named
    <code>min_max_inv</code> where you will download files for this
    final project.</div></li>

    <li><div>Open VS Code and in the "File" menu, click "Open Folder..."
    and open the <code>min_max_inv</code> folder that you created.</div></li>

    <li><div>Using VS Code on your computer, open a new terminal and
    execute the following commands.
    <ol>
        <li><div><code>npm install -g firebase-tools</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>firebase login</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>firebase projects:list</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>firebase init</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>firebase init hosting</code></div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Download the following five files and save them into the
    <code>public</code> folder that the firebase init hosting command
    created:
    <ol>
        <li><div><a download href="index.html">index.html</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a download href="min_max_inv.css">min_max_inv.css</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a download href="min_max_inv.js">min_max_inv.js</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a download href="favicon.png">favicon.png</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a download href="minmax.png">minmax.png</a></div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Execute the following command in the VS Code terminal:<br>
    <code>firebase deploy --only hosting</code>
    <p>If everything worked correctly, this command deployed the files
    for the Min-Max Inventory System into your Google Cloud
    project.</p></div></li>

    <li><div>Look in the terminal for the URL where the firebase deploy
    command sent your files. Copy that URL and open it in your
    browser.</div></li>

    <li><div>Using your browser, test your Min-Max Inventory system
    thoroughly by doing the following:
    <ol>
        <li><div>Look at each of the five tabs and verify that the each
        show the correct data from your Firestore database.</div></li>
        <li><div>In the Receiving tab, enter numbers in the text boxes,
        press the Submit button, and verify that the corresponding
        Current Quantities change as they should.</div></li>
        <li><div>In the Outgoing tab, enter numbers in the text boxes,
        press the Submit button, and verify that the corresponding
        Current Quantities change as they should.</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div>If you’re curious, you could ask your teacher or ChatGPT
    what is the purpose of each of the files in a web app.</div></li>
