<h1>ITM 101 Final Project</h1>
<p class="subtitle">(Min-Max Inventory System)</p>
<p class="subtitle">Part 1</p>

<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>Many companies have a storeroom or warehouse where they temporarily
store items that they will sell or use to manufacture products. The
items in a storeroom or warehouse are called <dfn>inventory</dfn>.</p>

<p>An <dfn>inventory system</dfn> is a computer system used by employees
to track items in a storeroom or warehouse. The employees must track the
inventory so that they know what items are available and what items need
to be ordered from a manufacturer. Companies want to store the right
amount of items in their warehouse. They want to store enough of all
items so that they can continue to manufacture products or sell to
customers. But storing more of an item than the company needs is costly
to the company.</p>

<p>A <dfn>min-max inventory system</dfn> is a simple inventory system
used by businesses to manage their inventory levels efficiently. In a
min-max inventory system, a company chooses a minimum (min) and maximum
(max) quantity for each item in inventory. When the current quantity of
an item drops to the minimum threshold, the system automatically
generates a reorder to bring the quantity back up to the maximum
level.</p>

<p>Your boss has asked you to create and deploy a min-max inventory
system that uses a NoSQL database in the Internet Cloud.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<p>Do the following:</p>
<ol class="long">
    <li><div>Use ChatGPT to learn about Google Firestore, what it is,
    and the steps a program must follow to use a Firestore database.
    Start a new chat with ChatGPT, and give the following prompts to
    ChatGPT. Use ChatGPT as a learning assistant. Read it’s answers, and
    ask it other questions that will help you understand Google
    Firestore and how to use it.
    <ol>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is a Google Firestore
        database?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">Is a Firebase Realtime database different
        from a Firestore database and which one is preferred?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How many companies use Firestore
        databases?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How does a Firestore database organize
        data?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">I’m going to ask you more questions about
        the Google Firestore database service. If you write any code as
        part of your answers, always write HTML and JavaScript code that
        uses Google’s Web modular API.</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">What do I need to do to create a Google
        Firebase project with a Firestore database that can be read and
        written by a JavaScript web application?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">What do I need to do to write a web app
        that uses a Firestore database?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">What steps are needed in a JavaScript web
        app to add a document to a Firestore database?</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Use the
    <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase Console</a>
    in your browser to create a new Firebase project named
    “min-max-inventory”. For this project, you can disable Google
    Analytics.</div></li>

    <li><div>Still using the Firebase Console, add a web app to your
    Firebase min-max-inventory project.</div></li>

    <li><div>Still using the Firebase Console, enable
    Hosting in your min-max-inventory project.</div></li>

    <li><div>Still using the Firebase Console, add a Firestore database
    to your Firebase project. Your new Firestore database should use
    <strong>test mode</strong>.</div></li>

    <li><div>On your computer create a new folder named
    <code>min_max_inv</code> where you will save files for this final
    project.</div></li>

    <li><div>In your Firestore database, initialize a collection named
    “suppliers” by doing the following:
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Give this prompt to ChatGPT:
        <p class="gpt">Please generate a list of 5 fictitious product
        suppliers in JSON format. Each item in the list must include
        three attributes:  supplier_name, email_address, and
        phone_number. Choose names that would fit into an animated
        cartoon like Wile E Coyote and the Roadrunner, Space Jam, and
        Roger Rabbit.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Wait for ChatGPT to respond and then give it this
        prompt:
        <p class="gpt">Please write HTML and JavaScript code in a single
        HTML file that will add the supplier data that you generated for
        the 5 suppliers into a Google Firestore database. The HTML must
        import version 10.12.4 of the Firebase and Firestore Web modular
        API as scripts of type="module". The JavaScript code must be
        contained in a function that a browser will execute after the
        HTML document is loaded. The JavaScript code must use the
        Firebase and Firestore Web modular API functions to add the
        supplier data into a collection named "suppliers". After adding
        each supplier, the JavaScript code must retrieve the document ID
        for the supplier and display the document ID and supplier name
        in a div in the HTML document.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Wait for ChatGPT to respond. Then copy the code that
        ChatGPT wrote and paste it into a new file named
        <code>init_suppliers.html</code> in VS Code.</div></li>

        <li><div>Look in the <code>init_suppliers.html</code> and find
        the <code>firebaseConfig</code> dictionary. You must replace the
        <code>firebaseConfig</code> dictionary that ChatGPT wrote with
        <code>firebaseConfig</code> code from the Firebase
        Console.</div></li>

        <li><div>In VS Code, save the <code>init_suppliers.html</code>
        file.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>init_suppliers.html</code> file in your
        browser. Your browser will execute the JavaScript code in that
        file which should add five suppliers to a collection named
        “suppliers” in your Firestore database. After adding the
        suppliers, your browser window should have a list of five
        supplier IDs and names. ONLY OPEN THIS FILE IN YOUR BROWSER ONCE.</div></li>

        <li><div>Using the Firebase console, verify that your Firestore
        database has a collection named “suppliers” that contains five
        documents.</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Initialize a collection named “products” in your Firestore
    database by doing the following:
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>In VS Code, create a new file named
        <code>init_products.html</code></div></li>

        <li><div>Copy the following prompt (not the results yet) and paste into the
        <code>init_products.html</code> file.
        <p class="gpt">Please generate a list of 20 products for a
        min-max inventory system for the cosmetics industry. Generate
        the list in JSON format. Each item in the list must include five
        attributes:  product_name, minimum_quantity, quantity,
        maximum_quantity, and supplier_id. Use these supplier IDs: </p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>From the Firestore Database, copy the five supplier IDs
        and paste them into VS Code at the bottom of the
        <code>init_products.html</code> file.</div></li>

        <li><div>Copy the prompt from your init_products.html file to ChatGPT and AI will give you more below to eventually replace the prompt.</div></li>

        <li><div>After ChatGPT responds, give it this prompt:
        <p class="gpt">Please write HTML and JavaScript code in a single
        HTML file that will add the product data that you generated into
        a Google Firestore database. The HTML must import version
        10.12.4 of the Firebase and Firestore Web modular API as scripts
        of type="module". The JavaScript code must be contained in a
        function that a browser will execute after the HTML document is
        loaded. The JavaScript code must use the Firebase and Firestore
        Web modular API functions to add the product data into a
        collection named "products". After adding each product, the
        JavaScript code must display the document ID and product name
        for the product in a div in the HTML document.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Wait for ChatGPT to respond. Then delete the prompt
        from the <code>init_products.html</code> file and copy the code
        that ChatGPT wrote and paste it into the
        <code>init_products.html</code> file.</div></li>

        <li><div>Look in the <code>init_products.html</code> file and
        replace the <code>firebaseConfig</code> dictionary with the
        <code>firebaseConfig</code> dictionary from your Firebase
        Console. (This is the same thing that you already did in the
        <code>init_suppliers.html</code> file.)</div></li>

        <li><div>Save the <code>init_products.html</code> file.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>init_products.html</code> file in your
        browser. Your browser will execute the JavaScript code in that
        file which should add 20 products to a collection named
        “products” in your Firestore database. After adding the
        products, your browser window should have a list of 20 product
        IDs and names.</div></li>

        <li><div>Using the Firebase console, verify that your Firestore
        database has a collection named “products” that contains 20
        documents.</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>If NodeJS is not installed on your computer, using a
    browser on your computer, download and install NodeJS from
    <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">https://nodejs.org/en/download</a></div></li>

    <li><div>Using your browser, download this
    <a download href="firestore.rules">firestore.rules</a>
    file and save it into the <code>min_max_inv</code> folder that you
    created.</div></li>

    <li><div>Open VS Code and in the “File” menu, click “Open Folder...”
    and open the <code>min_max_inv</code> folder that you created.</div></li>

    <li><div>Using VS Code on your computer, open a new terminal and
    execute the following commands.
    <ol>
        <li><div><code>npm install -g firebase-tools</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>firebase login</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>firebase projects:list</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>firebase init</code><br>
        (When you execute this command, your computer will ask you
        several questions about the firebase services that you want to
        initialize. Be sure to initialize both hosting and firestore
        database. Don’t initialize GitHub.)</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Using your browser, download the following five files and
    save them into the <code>public</code> folder created by the
    <code>firebase init</code> command in the previous step:
    <ol>
        <li><div><a download href="index.html">index.html</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a download href="min_max_inv.css">min_max_inv.css</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a download href="min_max_inv.js">min_max_inv.js</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a download href="favicon.svg">favicon.svg</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a download href="minmax.svg">minmax.svg</a></div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>In the <code>min_max_inv.js</code> file that you downloaded
    in previous step, at about line&nbsp;96, you will find these three
    lines of code:
<pre class="js">
/* Copy and paste your project's firebaseConfig here. */
const firebaseConfig = {
};
</pre>

    <p>Replace those three lines of code with the
    <code>firebaseConfig</code> code that you copied from the Firebase
    Console. (This is the same step that you already completed in the
    <code>init_suppliers.html</code> and <code>init_products.html</code>
    files.)</p></div></li>

    <li><div>In the VS Code terminal, execute the following command:
    <pre>firebase deploy --only "firestore,hosting"</pre>
    <p>If everything worked correctly, the command deployed the files
    for the Min-Max Inventory System into your Google Cloud
    project.</p></div></li>

    <li><div>Look in the VS Code terminal below the <code>fireabase
    deploy</code> command for the URL where the command sent your files.
    The URL will be similar to this:
    <pre>https://min-max-inventory-digits.web.app</pre>

    <p>Copy the URL from the VS Code terminal and open it in a new tab
    in your browser. Your browser should now display your
    min-max-inventory app with suppliers and products.</p></div></li>

    <li><div>If your browser does not display your min-max-inventory app
    but instead shows an error message that says your app is not
    available, you may need to submit a request to Palo Alto Networks to
    <a href="https://urlfiltering.paloaltonetworks.com/">reclassify your
    app’s URL</a>. Work with your teacher to do that.</div></li>

    <li><div>Using your browser, test your Min-Max Inventory system by
    doing the following:
    <ol>
        <li><div>Look at each of the five tabs and verify that the each
        show the correct data from your Firestore database.</div></li>
        <li><div>In the Receiving tab, enter numbers in the text boxes,
        press the Submit button, and verify that the corresponding
        Current Quantities change as they should.</div></li>
        <li><div>In the Outgoing tab, enter numbers in the text boxes,
        press the Submit button, and verify that the corresponding
        Current Quantities change as they should.</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>If you’re curious, you could ask your teacher or ChatGPT
    what is the purpose of each of the files (html, css, js) in a web
    app.</div></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="help">Help and Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If you are stuck, you may want to look at the previous project instructions from prior weeks.</p>

<h3>Your browser won’t show your app</h3>
<p>If your browser does not display your min-max-inventory app but
instead shows an error message that says your app is not available, you
may need to submit a request to Palo Alto Networks to
<a href="https://urlfiltering.paloaltonetworks.com/">reclassify your
app’s URL</a>. Work with your teacher to do that.</p>

<h3>No suppliers or no products</h3>
<p>Did you open your init_suppliers.html and init_products.html files in
your browser so that your browser could run them to create the suppliers
and the other file to create products?</p>

<p>You could temporarily replace your Firestore database rules in the
Firebase console with these rules:</p>
<pre>rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /suppliers/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
    match /products/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}</pre>
