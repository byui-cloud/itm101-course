<h1>ITM 101 Final Project</h1>
<p class="subtitle">(Min-Max Inventory System)</p>
<p class="subtitle">Part 1</p>

<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>Many companies have a storeroom or warehouse where they temporarily
store items that they will sell or use to manufacture products. The
items in a storeroom or warehouse are called <dfn>inventory</dfn>.</p>

<p>An <dfn>inventory system</dfn> is a computer system used by employees
to track items in a storeroom or warehouse. The employees must track the
inventory so that they know what items are available and what items need
to be ordered from a manufacturer. Companies want to store the right
amount of items in their warehouse. They want to store enough of all
items so that they can continue to manufacture products or sell to
customers. But storing more of an item than the company needs is costly
to the company.</p>

<p>A <dfn>min-max inventory system</dfn> is a simple inventory system
used by businesses to manage their inventory levels efficiently. In a
min-max inventory system, a company chooses a minimum (min) and maximum
(max) quantity for each item in inventory. When the current quantity of
an item drops to the minimum threshold, the system automatically
generates a reorder to bring the quantity back up to the maximum
level.</p>

<p>Your boss has asked you to create and deploy a min-max inventory
system that uses a NoSQL database in the Internet Cloud.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<p>Do the following:</p>
<ol class="long">
    <li><div>Use ChatGPT to learn about Google Firestore, what it is,
    and the steps a program must follow to use a Firestore database.
    Start a new chat with ChatGPT, and give the following prompts to
    ChatGPT. Use ChatGPT as a learning assistant. Read it’s answers, and
    ask it other questions that will help you understand Google
    Firestore and how to use it.
    <ol>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is a Google Firestore
        database?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">Is a Firebase Realtime database different
        from a Firestore database and which one is preferred?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How many companies use Firestore
        databases?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How does a Firestore database organize
        data?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">I’m going to ask you more questions about
        the Google Firestore database service. If you write any code as
        part of your answers, always write HTML and JavaScript code that
        uses Google’s Web modular API.</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">What do I need to do to create a Google
        Firebase project with a Firestore database that can be read and
        written by a JavaScript web application?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">What do I need to do to write a web app
        that uses a Firestore database?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">What steps are needed in a JavaScript web
        app to add a document to a Firestore database?</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Use the
    <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase Console</a>
    in your browser to create a new Firebase project named
    “min-max-inventory”. For this project, you can disable Google
    Analytics.</div></li>

    <li><div>Still using the Firebase Console, add a web app to your
    Firebase min-max-inventory project.</div></li>

    <li><div>Still using the Firebase Console, enable
    Hosting in your min-max-inventory project.</div></li>

    <li><div>Still using the Firebase Console, add a Firestore database
    to your Firebase project. Your new Firestore database should use
    <strong>test mode</strong>.</div></li>

    <li><div>On your computer create a new folder named
    <code>min_max_inv</code> where you will save files for this final
    project.</div></li>

    <li><div>In your Firestore database, initialize a collection named
    “suppliers” by doing the following:
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Give this prompt to ChatGPT:
        <p class="gpt">Please generate a list of 5 fictitious product
        suppliers in JSON format. Each item in the list must include
        three attributes:  supplier_name, email_address, and
        phone_number. Choose names that would fit into an animated
        cartoon like Wile E Coyote and the Roadrunner, Space Jam, and
        Roger Rabbit.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Wait for ChatGPT to respond and then give it this
        prompt:
        <p class="gpt">Please write HTML and JavaScript code in a single
        HTML file that will add the supplier data that you generated for
        the 5 suppliers into a Google Firestore database. The HTML must
        import version 10.12.4 of the Firebase and Firestore Web modular
        API as scripts of type="module". The JavaScript code must be
        contained in a function that a browser will execute after the
        HTML document is loaded. The JavaScript code must use the
        Firebase and Firestore Web modular API functions to add the
        supplier data into a collection named "suppliers". After adding
        each supplier, the JavaScript code must retrieve the document ID
        for the supplier and display the document ID and supplier name
        in a div in the HTML document.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Wait for ChatGPT to respond. Then copy the code that
        ChatGPT wrote and paste it into a new file named
        <code>init_suppliers.html</code> in VS Code.</div></li>

        <li><div>Look in your <code>init_suppliers.html</code> and find
        the <code>firebaseConfig</code> dictionary. You must replace the
        <code>firebaseConfig</code> dictionary that ChatGPT wrote with
        <code>firebaseConfig</code> code from the Firebase
        Console.</div></li>

        <li><div>In VS Code, save your <code>init_suppliers.html</code>
        file.</div></li>

        <li><div><p>Open your <code>init_suppliers.html</code> file in
        your browser. Your browser will execute the JavaScript code in
        that file which should add five suppliers to a collection named
        “suppliers” in your Firestore database. After your browser adds
        the five suppliers, your browser window should have a list of
        five supplier IDs and names.</p>

        <p>If your browser successfully, added the five suppliers, don’t
        refresh, reload, or open your
        <code>init_suppliers.html</code> file again because each time
        you refresh, reload, or re-open your
        <code>init_suppliers.html</code> file, your browser will add the
        five suppliers to your Firestore database again. This means your
        Firestore database will contain multiple copies of each
        supplier, and you don't want that.</p></div></li>

        <li><div>Using the Firebase console, verify that your Firestore
        database has a collection named “suppliers” that contains five
        documents.</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Initialize a collection named “products” in your Firestore
    database by doing the following:
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>In VS Code, create a new file named
        <code>init_products.html</code>
        <p>You will use your new <code>init_products.html</code> file
        for two purposes. First, you will use it to build a prompt for
        ChatGPT. After building the prompt, you will give the prompt to
        ChatGPT. Second, you will use your
        <code>init_products.html</code> file to store and execute the
        code that ChatGPT writes for you.</p></div></li>

        <li><div>To begin building the prompt for ChatGPT, copy the
        following text and paste it into your
        <code>init_products.html</code> file:
        <p class="gpt">Please generate a list of 20 products for a
        min-max inventory system for the cosmetics industry. Generate
        the list in JSON format. Each item in the list must include five
        attributes:  product_name, minimum_quantity, quantity,
        maximum_quantity, and supplier_id. Use these supplier IDs: </p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>To finish building the prompt for ChatGPT, from your
        Firestore database, copy the five supplier IDs and paste them
        into VS Code at the bottom of your
        <code>init_products.html</code> file.
        <p>You have now copied and pasted text from the previous step
        and the five supplier IDs into a file in VS Code. This is a
        complete prompt to give to ChatGPT.</p></div></li>

        <li><div>Copy the complete prompt from your
        <code>init_products.html</code> file and give it to
        ChatGPT.</div></li>

        <li><div>After ChatGPT responds, give it this prompt:
        <p class="gpt">Please write HTML and JavaScript code in a single
        HTML file that will add the product data that you generated into
        a Google Firestore database. The HTML must import version
        10.12.4 of the Firebase and Firestore Web modular API as scripts
        of type="module". The JavaScript code must be contained in a
        function that a browser will execute after the HTML document is
        loaded. The JavaScript code must use the Firebase and Firestore
        Web modular API functions to add the product data into a
        collection named "products". After adding each product, the
        JavaScript code must display the document ID and product name
        for the product in a div in the HTML document.</p>

<h1>ITM 101 Final Project</h1>
<p class="subtitle">(Min-Max Inventory System)</p>
<p class="subtitle">Part 2</p>

<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>The Min-Max Inventory System that you created and deployed last time
is using development security rules. This means that anyone can view,
edit, and delete the data in your Firestore database. Your boss has
asked you to change the Min-Max Inventory System so that it
authenticates users and only allows authenticated users with the correct
permissions to view, edit, and delete the data.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<p>Do the following:</p>
<ol class="long">
    <li><div>Use ChatGPT to learn about Google Firebase authentication
    and Firestore security rules. Start a new chat with ChatGPT, and
    give the following prompts to ChatGPT. Use ChatGPT as a learning
    assistant. Read it’s answers, and ask it other questions that will
    help you understand Firebase authentication and Firestore security
    rules.
    <ol>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is authentication?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">Does Google Web Services include an
        authentication service?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How do I enable Google authentication for a
        Firebase project?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">What is the purpose of Firestore security
        rules?</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Use the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase Console</a>
    in your browser and open your min-max-inventory project.</div></li>

    <li><div>Still using the Firebase Console, enable Google
    authentication for your project by doing the following:
    <ol>
        <li><div>In the navigation frame on the left-hand side, expand
        the “Build” item.</div></li>
        <li><div>Click “Authentication” in the navigation
        frame.</div></li>
        <li><div>Click the “Get started” button.</div></li>
        <li><div>Click the “Sign-in Method” tab near the top of your
        browser window.</div></li>
        <li><div>Click “Google” from the list of “Additional
        providers”.</div></li>
        <li><div>Click the “Enable” switch.</div></li>
        <li><div>Change the “Publich-facing name” for your project to
        “min-max-inventory”.</div></li>
        <li><div>Choose a support email from the drop-down list.</div></li>
        <li><div>Click the “Save” button.</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Using your browser, download the
    <a download href="firestore.rules">filestore.rules</a> file and save
    it into the the <code>min_max_inv</code> folder that you created
    last week.</div></li>

    <li><div>Using your browser, download the following two files and
    save them into the <code>min_max_inv/public</code> folder that the
    <code>firebase init hosting</code> command created last week.
    Downloading these two files will replace two files that you
    downloaded last week.
    <ol>
        <li><div><a download href="index.html">index.html</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a download href="min_max_inv.js">min_max_inv.js</a></div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>In the <code>min_max_inv.js</code> file that you downloaded
    in the previous step, replace the <code>firebaseConfig</code>
    dictionary at line&nbsp;99 with code from the Firebase
    Console.</div></li>

    <li><div>In VS Code, open a new terminal and
    execute the following command:
    <pre>firebase deploy --only "firestore,hosting"</pre>
    </div></li>

    <li><div>Look in the VS Code terminal below the
    <code>fireabase deploy</code> command for the URL where the command
    sent your files. The URL will be similar to this:
    <pre>https://min-max-inventory-DIGITS.web.app</pre></div></li>

    <li><div>Copy the URL from the VS Code terminal and open it in a new
    tab in your browser. Opening the URL in your browser should cause
    your browser to open a pop-up window and request sign in credentials
    from Google. If your browser blocks the pop-up window, click the
    pop-up blocked icon and enable pop-up windows for your Min-Max
    Inventory app and then reload your app in your browser.</div></li>

    <li><div>If you’re not already signed into your Google account, you
    must sign into one. After you sign in, your Min-Max Inventory app
    will display your name, email address, and application user ID at
    the top of the application window.</div></li>

    <li><div>Using the Firebase Console in your browser, add a new
    collection named “users” to your Firestore database. This is case
    sensitive. It must be “users” and not “Users”.</div></li>

    <li><div>Still using the Firebase Console, add a document to the
    “users” collection.
    <ol>
        <li><div>For the “Document ID”, don’t click the “Auto-ID”
        button. Instead, copy and paste your application user ID which
        will be in your browser at the top of your Min-Max Inventory app
        tab.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add two fields named “email” and “enabled” to
        the document. The “enabled” field must by of type boolean as shown
        in the following screenshot:
        <img src="addDoc.png" style="width:100%"
        alt="Screenshot of a popup window to add a document to the users
        collection"
        title="Screenshot of a popup window to add a document to the users
        collection"></div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Reload your Min-Max Inventory system in your browser. All
    of the tabs (Suppliers, Products, Receiving, and Outgoing) should
    display data from your Firestore database. If any of the tabs don’t
    contain data, you may have created the user document incorrectly in
    the previous step.</div></li>

    <li><div>Using your browser, test your Min-Max Inventory system
    thoroughly by doing the following:
    <ol>
        <li><div>Look at each of the five tabs and verify that they all
        show the correct data from your Firestore database.</div></li>
        <li><div>In the Receiving tab, enter numbers in the text boxes,
        press the Submit button, and verify that the corresponding
        Current Quantities change as they should.</div></li>
        <li><div>In the Outgoing tab, enter numbers in the text boxes,
        press the Submit button, and verify that the corresponding
        Current Quantities change as they should.</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <!--
    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div></div></li>

    <li><div>Using your browser in the Firebase console, enable
    authentication.</div></li>

    <li><div>If you’re curious, you could ask your teacher or ChatGPT
    what is the purpose of each of the files in a web app.</div></li>
    -->
</ol>

<h2 id="stretch">Stretch Challenges (Complete one for 5 points)</h2>
<p>You can learn about creating, writing, securing, testing, and
depolying applications in the Internet Cloud by doing any of the
following.</p>
<ol class="long">
    <li><div>Make it possible for some users to only read data in the
    Firestore database and for other users to read and write. You could
    do this by
    <ol>
        <li><div>Changing the structure of user documents in the
        Firestore database from
        <pre>{email: "pedro@example.com", enabled: true}</pre>
        to
        <pre>{email: "pedro@example.com", canRead: true, canWrite: false}</pre>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Adding more users to your Firestore database, some with
        <code>canRead:true</code> and <code>canWrite:false</code> and
        others with both <code>canRead</code> and <code>canWrite</code>
        set to <code>true</code></div></li>

        <li><div>In the <code>firestore.rules</code> file, replacing the
        <code>userHasPermission</code> function with a function named
        <code>userCanRead</code> that checks the <code>canRead</code>
        document field and using the <code>userCanRead</code> function
        in <code>allow read</code> parts of the <code>match</code>
        rules.</div></li>

        <li><div>In the <code>firestore.rules</code> file, adding a
        <code>userCanWrite</code> function that checks the
        <code>canWrite</code> document field and using the
        <code>userCanWrite</code> function in the <code>allow
        write</code> parts of the <code>match</code> rules.</div></li>

        <li><div>Deploying your modified <code>firestore.rules</code> by
        executing this command in a VS Code terminal:
        <pre>firebase deploy --only "firestore,hosting"</pre></div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Change your application’s favicon
    (<img src="../../week12/min_max_inv/favicon.svg" style="width:1.5em"
    alt="The favicon for the Min Max Inventory system">)
    or the Min Max icon
    (<img src="../../week12/min_max_inv/minmax.svg" style="width:3em"
    alt="The icon for the Min Max Inventory system">).
    Ask ChatGPT the following:
    <ol>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is an svg file?</div></li>
        <li><div class="gpt">What are some free popular computer
        programs for creating svg files?</div></li>
        <li><div class="gpt">What size should a web application’s
        favicon be?</div></li>
    </ol>
    Then create some new icons and deploy them to your by executing this
    command in a VS Code terminal:
    <pre>firebase deploy --only "firestore,hosting"</pre></div></li>

    <li><div>Change the background color, font color, font family, or
    font size in your Min-Max Inventory app. This will require you to
    change and deploy your <code>min_max_inv.css</code> file. Ask
    ChatGPT the following:
    <ol>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is the purpose of a css file in a web
        application?</div></li>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is a selector in a css

        <li><div class="gpt">Please teach me about simple css
        selectors.</div></li>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is a css variable and how do I create

        <li><div class="gpt">Please write a css rule to change to
        backround color of the body of an HTML document.</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Add a tab to your application that lets a user view orders
    in a tab named “Orders” that is like the “Suppliers” tab. This will
    require you to add code to both the <code>index.html</code> and
    <code>min_max_inv.js</code> files. Examine your existing
    <code>index.html</code> file and find the HTML tags that create each
    tab and corresponding section. Add a new tab and section and test
    your changed <code>index.html</code> file. Alternatively, you could
    give ChatGPT the HTML code for the Suppliers tab and ask it to
    create code for an Orders tab that is similar to the Suppliers code.
    After you change and test your <code>index.html</code> file, add
    code to your  <code>min_max_inv.js</code> file for the “Orders”
    tab.</div></li>

        <li><div>Wait for ChatGPT to respond. Then delete the prompt
        from your <code>init_products.html</code> file. Then copy and
        paste the code that ChatGPT wrote into your
        <code>init_products.html</code> file. In other words, replace
        the prompt in your <code>init_products.html</code> file with the
        code that ChatGPT wrote.</div></li>

        <li><div>Look in your <code>init_products.html</code> file and
        replace the <code>firebaseConfig</code> dictionary with the
        <code>firebaseConfig</code> dictionary from your Firebase
        Console. (This is the same thing that you already did in your
        <code>init_suppliers.html</code> file.)</div></li>

        <li><div>Save your <code>init_products.html</code> file.</div></li>

        <li><div><p>Open your <code>init_products.html</code> file in
        your browser. Your browser will execute the JavaScript code in
        that file which should add 20 products to a collection named
        “products” in your Firestore database. After adding the
        products, your browser window should have a list of 20 product
        IDs and names.</p>

        <p>If your browser successfully, added the 20 products, don’t
        refresh, reload, or open your <code>init_products.html</code>
        file again because each time you refresh, reload, or re-open
        your <code>init_products.html</code> file, your browser will add
        the 20 products to your Firestore database again. This means
        your Firestore database will contain multiple copies of each
        product, and you don't want that.</p></div></li>

        <li><div>Using the Firebase console, verify that your Firestore
        database has a collection named “products” that contains 20
        documents.</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>If NodeJS is not installed on your computer, using a
    browser on your computer, download and install NodeJS from
    <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">https://nodejs.org/en/download</a></div></li>

    <li><div>Using your browser, download this
    <a download href="firestore.rules">firestore.rules</a>
    file and save it into the <code>min_max_inv</code> folder that you
    created.</div></li>

    <li><div>Open VS Code and in the “File” menu, click “Open Folder...”
    and open the <code>min_max_inv</code> folder that you created.</div></li>

    <li><div>Using VS Code on your computer, open a new terminal and
    execute the following commands.
    <ol>
        <li><div><code>npm install -g firebase-tools</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>firebase login</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>firebase projects:list</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>firebase init</code><br>
        (When you execute this command, your computer will ask you
        several questions about the firebase services that you want to
        initialize. Be sure to initialize both hosting and firestore
        database. Don’t initialize GitHub.)</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Using your browser, download the following five files and
    save them into the <code>public</code> folder created by the
    <code>firebase init</code> command in the previous step:
    <ol>
        <li><div><a download href="index.html">index.html</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a download href="min_max_inv.css">min_max_inv.css</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a download href="min_max_inv.js">min_max_inv.js</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a download href="favicon.svg">favicon.svg</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a download href="minmax.svg">minmax.svg</a></div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>In the <code>min_max_inv.js</code> file that you downloaded
    in previous step, at about line&nbsp;96, you will find these three
    lines of code:
<pre class="js">
/* Copy and paste your project's firebaseConfig here. */
const firebaseConfig = {
};
</pre>

    <p>Replace those three lines of code with the
    <code>firebaseConfig</code> code that you copied from the Firebase
    Console. (This is the same step that you already completed in the
    <code>init_suppliers.html</code> and <code>init_products.html</code>
    files.)</p></div></li>

    <li><div>In the VS Code terminal, execute the following command:
    <pre>firebase deploy --only "firestore,hosting"</pre>
    <p>If everything worked correctly, the command deployed the files
    for the Min-Max Inventory System into your Google Cloud
    project.</p></div></li>

    <li><div>Look in the VS Code terminal below the <code>fireabase
    deploy</code> command for the URL where the command sent your files.
    The URL will be similar to this:
    <pre>https://min-max-inventory-digits.web.app</pre>

    <p>Copy the URL from the VS Code terminal and open it in a new tab
    in your browser. Your browser should now display your
    min-max-inventory app with suppliers and products.</p></div></li>

    <li><div>If your browser does not display your min-max-inventory app
    but instead shows an error message that says your app is not
    available, you may need to submit a request to Palo Alto Networks to
    <a href="https://urlfiltering.paloaltonetworks.com/">reclassify your app’s URL</a>.
    Work with your teacher to do that.</div></li>

    <li><div>Using your browser, test your Min-Max Inventory system by
    doing the following:
    <ol>
        <li><div>Look at each of the five tabs and verify that the each
        show the correct data from your Firestore database.</div></li>
        <li><div>In the Receiving tab, enter numbers in the text boxes,
        press the Submit button, and verify that the corresponding
        Current Quantities change as they should.</div></li>
        <li><div>In the Outgoing tab, enter numbers in the text boxes,
        press the Submit button, and verify that the corresponding
        Current Quantities change as they should.</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>If you’re curious, you could ask your teacher or ChatGPT
    what is the purpose of each of the files (html, css, js) in a web
    app.</div></li>
</ol>

<h3>Your browser won’t show your app</h3>
<p>If your browser does not display your min-max-inventory app but
instead shows an error message that says your app is not available, you
may need to submit a request to Palo Alto Networks to
<a href="https://urlfiltering.paloaltonetworks.com/">reclassify your app’s URL</a>.
Work with your teacher to do that.</p>

<h3>No suppliers or no products</h3>
<p>Did you open your init_suppliers.html and init_products.html files in
your browser so that your browser could run them to create the suppliers
and the products in your Firestore database?</p>

<p>You could temporarily replace your Firestore database rules in the
Firebase console with these rules:</p>
<pre>rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /suppliers/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
    match /products/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}</pre>
