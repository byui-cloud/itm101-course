<h1>ITM 101 Final Project</h1>
<p class="subtitle">(Min-Max Inventory System)</p>

<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>An inventory system is a computer system used by employees at a
company to track items in a storeroom or warehouse. The employees must
track the inventory so that they know what parts are available and
what parts need to be ordered from a manufacturer.</p>

<p>A min-max inventory system is a simple inventory system used by
businesses to manage their inventory levels efficiently. In a min-max
inventory system, a minimum (min) and maximum (max) quantity are
established for each item in stock. When the inventory level of an item
drops to the minimum threshold, the system automatically generates a
reorder to bring the stock back up to the maximum level.</p>

<p>Your boss has asked you to create and deploy a min-max inventory
system that uses a NoSQL database in the Internet Cloud.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<p>Do the following:</p>
<ol class="long">
    <li><div>Use the
    <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase Console</a>
    to create a new Firebase project named “min-max-inventory”.</div></li>

    <li><div>Within your Firebase min-max-inventory project, add a
    Firestore database.</div></li>

    <li><div>Initialize a collection named “suppliers” in your Firestore
    database by doing the following:

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Start a new chat with ChatGPT, and give this prompt to
        ChatGTP:

        <p class="gpt">Please generate a list of 5 fictitious product
        suppliers in JSON format. Each item in the list must include
        three attributes:  a supplier name, email address, and phone
        number. Choose names that would fit into an animated cartoon
        like Wile E Coyote and the Roadrunner, Space Jam, and Roger
        Rabbit.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Wait for ChatGPT to respond and then give it this
        prompt:

        <p class="gpt">Please write HTML and JavaScript code in a single
        HTML file that will add the supplier data that you generated for
        the 5 suppliers into a Google Firestore database. The HTML must
        import the Firebase and Firestore Web modular API as scripts of
        type="module". The JavaScript code must be contained in a
        function that a browser will execute after the HTML document is
        loaded. The JavaScript code must use the Firebase and Firestore
        Web modular API functions to add the supplier data into a
        collection named "suppliers". After adding each supplier, the
        JavaScript code must retrieve the document ID for the supplier
        and display the document ID and supplier name in a div in the
        HTML document.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Wait for ChatGPT to respond. Then copy the code that
        ChatGPT wrote and paste it into a new file.</div></li>

        <li><div>Save the file as init_suppliers_gpt.html</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the init_suppliers_gpt.html file in a browser, and
        your browser should add five suppliers to a collection named
        “suppliers” in your Firestore database. The browser window
        should now have a list of five supplier IDs and names.</div></li>

        <li><div>Copy the five supplier IDs into a new file in VS
        Code.</div></li>

        <li><div>Using the Firebase console, verify that your Firestore
        database has a collection named “suppliers” that contains five
        documents.</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Initialize a collection named “products” in your Firestore
    database by doing the following:
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Copy the following prompt and paste it at the top of
        the file in VS Code that contains the five supplier IDs from the
        previous step.
        <p class="gpt">Please generate a list of 20 products for a
        min-max inventory system for the cosmetics industry. Generate
        the list in JSON format. Each item in the list must include five
        attributes: a product name, minimum quantity, quantity, maximum
        quantity, and supplier ID. Use these supplier IDs: </p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Review the prompt and ensure that it makes sense. Then
        give the prompt to ChatGPT.</div></li>

        <li><div>After ChatGPT responds, give it this prompt:

        <p class="gpt">Please write HTML and JavaScript code in a single
        HTML file that will add the product data that you generated into
        a Google Firestore database. The HTML must import the Firebase
        and Firestore Web modular API as scripts of type="module". The
        JavaScript code must be contained in a function that a browser
        will execute after the HTML document is loaded. The JavaScript
        code must use the Firebase and Firestore Web modular API
        functions to add the product data into a collection named
        "products". After adding each product, the JavaScript code must
        display the document ID and product name for the product in a
        div in the HTML document.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Wait for ChatGPT to respond. Then copy the code that
        ChatGPT wrote and paste it into a new file.</div></li>

        <li><div>Save the file as init_products_gpt.html</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the init_products_gpt.html file in a browser, and
        your browser should add 20 products to a collection named
        “products” in your Firestore database. The browser window should
        now have a list of 20 product IDs and names.</div></li>

        <li><div>Using the Firebase console, verify that your Firestore
        database has a collection named “products” that contains 20
        documents.</div></li>
