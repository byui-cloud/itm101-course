<h1>ITM 101 Final Project</h1>
<p class="subtitle">(Min-Max Inventory System)</p>
<p class="subtitle">Part 2</p>

<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>The Min-Max Inventory System that you created last week is using
development security rules. This means that anyone can view, edit, and
delete the data in your Firestore database.</p>

<p>Your boss has asked you to change the Min-Max Inventory System so
that it authenticates users and only allows authenticated users with the
correct permissions to view, edit, and delete the data.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<p>Do the following:</p>
<ol class="long">
    <li><div>Using your browser in the Firebase console, enable
    authentication.</div></li>

    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div></div></li>

    <li><div>Use ChatGPT to learn about Google Firestore, what it is,
    and the steps a program must follow to use a Firestore database.
    Start a new chat with ChatGPT, and give the following prompts to
    ChatGPT. Use ChatGPT as a learning assistant. Read it’s answers, and
    ask it other questions that will help you understand Google
    Firestore and how to use it.
    <ol>
        <li><div class="gpt">What is a Google Firestore
        database?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How many companies use Firestore
        databases?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">How does a Firestore database organize
        data?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">I’m going to ask you more questions about
        the Google Firestore database service. If you write any code as
        part of your answers, always write JavaScript code that uses
        Google’s Web modular API.</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">What do I need to do to write a web app
        that uses a Firestore database?</div></li>

        <li><div class="gpt">What steps are needed in a JavaScript web
        app to add a document to a Firestore database?</div></li>
    </ol>
    </div></li>

    <li><div>Use the
    <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase Console</a>
    to create a new Firebase project named “min-max-inventory”.</div></li>

    <li><div>Within your Firebase min-max-inventory project, add a
    Firestore database that has open or development rules.</div></li>

    <li><div>Initialize a collection named “suppliers” in your Firestore
    database by doing the following:
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Give this prompt to ChatGPT:

        <p class="gpt">Please generate a list of 5 fictitious product
        suppliers in JSON format. Each item in the list must include
        three attributes:  a supplier name, email address, and phone
        number. Choose names that would fit into an animated cartoon
        like Wile E Coyote and the Roadrunner, Space Jam, and Roger
        Rabbit.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Wait for ChatGPT to respond and then give it this
        prompt:

        <p class="gpt">Please write HTML and JavaScript code in a single
        HTML file that will add the supplier data that you generated for
        the 5 suppliers into a Google Firestore database. The HTML must
        import the Firebase and Firestore Web modular API as scripts of
        type="module". The JavaScript code must be contained in a
        function that a browser will execute after the HTML document is
        loaded. The JavaScript code must use the Firebase and Firestore
        Web modular API functions to add the supplier data into a
        collection named "suppliers". After adding each supplier, the
        JavaScript code must retrieve the document ID for the supplier
        and display the document ID and supplier name in a div in the
        HTML document.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Wait for ChatGPT to respond. Then copy the code that
        ChatGPT wrote and paste it into a new file.</div></li>

        <li><div>Save the file as init_suppliers_gpt.html</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the init_suppliers_gpt.html file in a browser, and
        your browser should add five suppliers to a collection named
        “suppliers” in your Firestore database. The browser window
        should now have a list of five supplier IDs and names.</div></li>

        <li><div>Copy the five supplier IDs into a new file in VS
        Code.</div></li>

        <li><div>Using the Firebase console, verify that your Firestore
        database has a collection named “suppliers” that contains five
        documents.</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div>Initialize a collection named “products” in your Firestore
    database by doing the following:
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Copy the following prompt and paste it at the top of
        the file in VS Code that contains the five supplier IDs from the
        previous step.
        <p class="gpt">Please generate a list of 20 products for a
        min-max inventory system for the cosmetics industry. Generate
        the list in JSON format. Each item in the list must include five
        attributes: a product name, minimum quantity, quantity, maximum
        quantity, and supplier ID. Use these supplier IDs: </p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Review the prompt and ensure that it makes sense. Then
        give the prompt to ChatGPT.</div></li>

        <li><div>After ChatGPT responds, give it this prompt:

        <p class="gpt">Please write HTML and JavaScript code in a single
        HTML file that will add the product data that you generated into
        a Google Firestore database. The HTML must import the Firebase
        and Firestore Web modular API as scripts of type="module". The
        JavaScript code must be contained in a function that a browser
        will execute after the HTML document is loaded. The JavaScript
        code must use the Firebase and Firestore Web modular API
        functions to add the product data into a collection named
        "products". After adding each product, the JavaScript code must
        display the document ID and product name for the product in a
        div in the HTML document.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Wait for ChatGPT to respond. Then copy the code that
        ChatGPT wrote and paste it into a new file.</div></li>

        <li><div>Save the file as init_products_gpt.html</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the init_products_gpt.html file in a browser, and
        your browser should add 20 products to a collection named
        “products” in your Firestore database. The browser window should
        now have a list of 20 product IDs and names.</div></li>

        <li><div>Using the Firebase console, verify that your Firestore
        database has a collection named “products” that contains 20
        documents.</div></li>
    </ol></div></li>

    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div></div></li>

    <li><div>If you’re curious, you could ask your teacher or ChatGPT
    what is the purpose of each of the files in a web app.</div></li>
